Now, what is an expert system? Let's examine the phrase itself.
"Expert" "System".
Expert, meaning that it would have some knowledge or expertise about a subject.
System, meaning that it would be a computerised solution.
Therefore, we can say that an expert system is a program that can mimic human expertise about a specific subject.
They are made up of a knowledge base, inference engine and a user interface.
The knowledge base is populated by expert knowledge, be it from books, interviewing people, or from records of previous occurances.
Expert systems have use in many industries, including medicine, finance and law.
A major advantage of expert systems is that they can provide unbiased expertise in any situtation in their specific domain, and maintain the quality of the information provided.

Now, lets talk about, in hindsight, a very important advancements in this field, namely, the R1 expert system.
The R1 system, also known as the XCON system (and called as so interchangeably in this presentation), was a production-rule based system made in created in 1978, and is notable as the first ever expert systems to find wide use in industry.
It was written in the OPS5 language, which is a rule based or production system language, by John McDermott of Carnegie Mellon University.
Digital Equipments Corporation, also known as DEC or simply as Digital, had this system created to assist in the ordering of the VAX computer, which was a very successful microcomputer developed in the 70s.
In those days, a computer was not bought as an integrated system. Off-the-shelf components had to be bought and assembled to form a computer, including the processor, RAM, and even cabling.
DEC, as a leading manufacturer, had a business strategy of offerign loads of flexibility in the configuration of their computers.
This, not surprisingly, led to a problem of millions of possible configurations, making selecting the correct configuration difficult, even for the people selling the systems.
The process of ordering the system was a convoluted process. The first steps heavily relied on skilled and techincal editors, whereas the final step was assembly and testing of the system itself.
This process took a long time, estimated to anywhere between two and three months, with some systems even taking six months.
Also, with the growing complexity of new systems offered by DEC, the number of configuration options rose, real quick.
Initially, DEC attempted to write a conventional system to configure a given system, but failed, and the R1 configuration system was instead commissioned.
The R1 system eliminated the need for testing the system, as the components it recommended were always intercompatible.
This majorly reduced the time taken between order and delivery from months to weeks, and in come cases even days.
DEC remained competitive in the 1980s with this system due to it offering much faster order delivery.
The system had very positive financial consequences for the company, saving the company an estimated $25 million a year, as the company did not have to send out free components to customers due to technician errors, and also due to major speedups in the ordering process in general, increasing customer satisfaction.

### working
The XCON expert system worked by using a rule-based approach to generate customized configurations for VAX computer systems (Virtual Address extension)
Here's how it worked in more detail:

The user would specify the desired configuration options for their VAX system, such as the amount of memory, number of disk drives, and type of CPU. These options would be input into the XCON system through a user interface.

The XCON system would then use its rule-based knowledge representation to generate a customized configuration for the VAX system. The knowledge base contained a set of rules that specified how different components of the VAX system should be configured based on the user's input.

The inference engine would then use backward chaining to apply the rules in the knowledge base to the user's input. It would start with the most specific rules that matched the user's input, and then work its way up the hierarchy of rules to more general rules as needed.

As the inference engine applied the rules, it would generate a customized configuration for the VAX system. The configuration would be validated and optimized to ensure that it met the user's requirements and was compatible with the VAX hardware and software.

The XCON system would then output the customized configuration to the user, who could review and approve it. Once approved, the configuration would be used to order and assemble the customized VAX system.

Overall, the XCON system automated the configuration process for VAX computer systems, which were complex and highly configurable. By using expert knowledge to generate configurations, XCON reduced the time and cost required to deliver customized systems to customers, while also ensuring that the configurations were optimal and met the customer's requirements.

### application
XCON/R1 expert system was first developed in the early 1980s and was widely used in the aerospace industry for automating decision-making processes related to the manufacturing of components for aircraft. Some of the specific applications of XCON/R1 expert system include:

Design of components: XCON/R1 was used to recommend the design of various components of an aircraft, such as wings, engines, and fuselage. The system used its knowledge base to identify the best materials and manufacturing processes for these components.

Material selection: The system was used to recommend the selection of materials for various components of the aircraft based on the specific requirements of the component. For example, XCON/R1 could recommend the use of lightweight materials for components that need to be strong and durable.

Quality control: XCON/R1 was used to monitor the manufacturing process to ensure that all components meet the required standards of quality. The system could identify potential problems and recommend corrective actions to prevent defects.

Maintenance and repair: The system was also used to recommend maintenance and repair procedures for various components of the aircraft. XCON/R1 could identify the cause of a problem and recommend the appropriate repair procedure.

Overall, XCON/R1 expert system demonstrated the potential of AI in automating decision-making processes in complex manufacturing environments. Its success in the aerospace industry paved the way for the development of other expert systems in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.

Complexity: Developing a configuration expert system like R1 can be complex and time-consuming. It requires a high degree of expertise in both the domain and AI, and may require significant resources to implement.

Maintenance: Once a configuration expert system is developed and deployed, it may require ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure that it continues to function correctly and meet the changing needs of users.

Limited applicability: While the R1 system is highly flexible, it may not be suitable for all applications or industries. Some domains may require more specialized knowledge representation schemes or inference engines, for example.

Dependence on user input: Configuration expert systems like R1 rely heavily on accurate input from users in order to generate suitable configurations. If users provide incomplete or incorrect information, the system may not be able to generate accurate or optimal configurations.

Limitations of rule-based reasoning: While rule-based reasoning is a powerful technique used in configuration expert systems like R1, it has some limitations. For example, it may not be able to handle complex or uncertain scenarios, or cases where multiple conflicting rules apply.
