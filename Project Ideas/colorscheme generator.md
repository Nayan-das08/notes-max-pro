%% project description %%
- use Generative AI to generate a colorscheme using text-prompt
- possible way to do this is 
	- gen image, extract colors
	- or directly generate hex codes
- generate colorschemes for multiple editors
	- vscode
	- helix
	- sublime
	- vim/neovim
- inspired from https://github.com/svermeulen/text-to-colorschemeo
- functionality to 
	- save colorschemes
	- preview
		- maybe using something like _codesnap_ (https://github.com/kufii/CodeSnap)
		- preview multiple languages
- the generative model must be specific to this use case
	- not a general text based chatbot (GPT n shit)
- start with a single colour
