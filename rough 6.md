# 2. Introduction
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope are two of the most important imaging instruments in the field of astronomy. While often referred to as Hubble's successor, Webb has a unique scientific mission that builds on the achievements of its predecessor. With its large primary mirror and impressive infrared capabilities, Webb has the ability to explore the earliest stages of the universe's formation, including the emergence of our solar system and the earliest signs of cosmic light following the Big Bang.

While both telescopes have gathered invaluable scientific data, the quality of their images is not always sufficient to reveal the shapes, colors, and textures of celestial bodies. As such, digital image processing techniques have become essential tools for enhancing the quality of the photographs captured by these instruments. These techniques involve the use of spectroscopic analysis, noise reduction, image restoration, and color balancing to bring out the features of astronomical objects and enable further analysis by NASA experts.

To produce high-quality images for scientific and public consumption, image processors must carefully minimize the presence of artifacts while preserving the integrity of the data. The pre-processing stage of data preparation involves the detection and removal of various artifacts, as the data is initially collected in its most unprocessed form. Subsequently, individual photographs are combined and color-balanced to produce press release images.

One of the challenges associated with capturing images from distant celestial objects is the potential for extraneous light to enter the image as it travels through space and time. This may arise from a variety of sources, including internal reflections within the telescope and detector. As such, this review paper will explore various defects and artifacts that originate within the detector itself, as well as the techniques employed to minimize their impact on the captured images.

# 4. Scope of the Review
**Charge Bleed**
Charge-coupled devices (CCD), the same kind of technology used in smartphone cameras, constitute the basis of Hubble's imaging detectors. When a source in the field of vision is sufficiently bright that it overwhelms specific detector pixels, this is known as charge bleed. The brighter portions of the image bleed into the darker area as a result. This can be quite challenging to clean up in photographs with extremely bright stars. Cleaning this artefact, though, ought to be simple if the bright star is surrounded by a largely homogeneous background. The best approach is to use actual data from a different image of the same source that has been rotated so that it can be used in place of the data in the bleed. In the absence of this ideal circumstance, charge bleed can be fixed by choosing and copying a clear portion of the star that is perpendicular to the bleed, rotating it 90 degrees, and then carefully blending it into the charge bleed, taking care not to obstruct or add elements to the image.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
It is inevitable that CCDs deteriorate and lose charge transfer efficiency as they get older, and CTE does alter with time. The data calibration programme essentially packs that charge back into its array of pixels thanks to the tools the software wizards at STScI have designed to account for this effect. The end user receiving data from MAST will almost never see this effect unless specifically looking for it because this fix is executed as part of the standard processing pipeline.

**Pixel Problems**
Dead pixels, Hot pixels, Cold pixels, Unstable pixels - all these terms are used to describe specific detector pixels that do not function as planned. They can either emit a maximum signal all the time (hot pixel) or no signal at all (dead pixel) depending on the situation. Most of the time, these are well known, are depicted on the detector, and may be considered during data calibration. In the WFC3/IR detector, for instance, there is a well-known circular region of dead pixels that has been affectionately dubbed the "death star" and is even included in planning software to assist scientists in avoiding placing anything significant on that region of the detector while arranging observations. These problematic pixels are inevitable throughout the creation of image detectors and are typically not a warning sign for more serious issues. The extreme conditions of space do cause the detectors to deteriorate with time, but again, these issue areas may be considered and dealt with in calibration. Once the data are merged to generate an integrated image, taking many exposures and slightly shifting the telescope or detector between exposures also aids in mitigating these issues.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
The sky is a very minor portion of Hubble's entire field of view.  Therefore, astronomers plan out numerous overlapping observations to construct a mosaic in order to obtain photographs that span a wider section of the sky. Then, these data must be precisely calibrated to ensure that the background levels are consistent from one mosaic frame to the next. Even with such meticulous calibration, there will inevitably be spots close to the overlaps that don't quite match and need to be fixed. Typically, this is done by making local brightness/contrast adjustments to match the backdrop levels. Science programmes don't always aim to produce a precisely square mosaic, thus there can be data gaps that might be filled in with information from other programmes or, if accessible, ground-based data.

# 5. Solutions
**Charge Bleed**
In the paper "Image-processing techniques for the creation of presentation-quality astronomical images," Rector et al. (2007) address the issue of charge bleed, which is a common problem encountered in astronomical imaging. Charge bleed occurs when an excess charge spills over from one pixel to another during readout, leading to blooming or streaking effects in the resulting images.

To mitigate the charge bleed problem, Rector et al. employed a number of image-processing techniques, including bias subtraction, flat-fielding, and cosmic ray rejection. Bias subtraction involves subtracting a bias frame, which is a dark image taken with zero exposure time, from each astronomical image to correct for the bias signal generated by the detector. Flat-fielding corrects for pixel-to-pixel variations in the detector response by dividing each astronomical image by a flat-field frame, which is an image of a uniformly illuminated field. Cosmic ray rejection involves identifying and removing cosmic rays, which are energetic particles that strike the detector and create spurious signal spikes.

In addition to these standard techniques, Rector et al. developed a novel approach to deal with charge bleed, which they call "charge-transfer tailoring." This method involves adjusting the timing and amplitude of the clock signals used to read out the detector in order to control the charge transfer between pixels. By carefully tuning the clock signals, Rector et al. were able to reduce the charge bleed and improve the image quality.

Overall, Rector et al.'s paper provides a comprehensive overview of the techniques used to create presentation-quality astronomical images, with a particular focus on addressing the charge bleed problem. Their use of both standard and novel techniques demonstrates the importance of a multi-faceted approach to image processing in astronomy.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) is a prevalent problem in astronomical imaging, particularly for space-based observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). CTI leads to a gradual loss of charge from pixels as they are transferred across the detector. This results in image artifacts such as trailing, streaking, and smearing, which can significantly affect the quality of scientific data. In this review, we discuss two papers that propose solutions for the charge bleed problem in HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).

The first paper by Massey et al. (2010) presents a pixel-based correction method for CTI in ACS. The authors developed an algorithm that uses a model of the detector's charge transfer process to correct the pixel values in each image. This model is based on the assumption that the charge transfer occurs along straight lines. The algorithm fits the pixel values along each line to this model and adjusts the pixel values to remove the CTI-induced artifacts. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method on both simulated and real ACS data, showing a significant improvement in image quality.

One of the most significant developments in this area came in 2014 when Massey et al. proposed an improved model of CTI and a correction algorithm for the HST. The model takes into account several factors that contribute to CTI, including variations in the charge transfer efficiency across the CCD detectors, the impact of cosmic rays on the detectors, and the non-uniform illumination of the CCDs. The correction algorithm developed by Massey et al. involves estimating the charge lost due to CTI by fitting a model to the charge trails left by stars in the image. This correction is then applied to the image to obtain an accurate representation of the original data.

The second paper by Desai et al. (2016) presents a more general approach to detecting and removing artifacts in astronomical images, including those caused by CTI. The authors proposed a method based on the use of median absolute deviation (MAD) maps. MAD maps are derived from the image data and provide an estimate of the expected noise level in each pixel. The authors used the MAD maps to identify pixels with anomalously high values, which they attributed to CTI-induced artifacts. The authors then used a combination of interpolation and local averaging to remove the artifacts from the images. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method on both simulated and real ACS data, showing a significant reduction in the CTI-induced artifacts.

CTI remains a significant challenge for astronomers using the HST, but researchers have made significant progress in developing solutions to this problem.

**Pixel Problems**
The following papers deal with pixel-related problems in the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instruments on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

The first paper by Medina, titled "UVIS Pixel Stability: Updates to The UVIS Bad Pixel Table Pipeline", discusses updates made to the Ultraviolet and Visual Light (UVIS) bad pixel table pipeline. The UVIS instrument on the HST is prone to developing bad pixels, which are pixels that produce incorrect or anomalous readings. These bad pixels can arise due to various reasons such as radiation damage, thermal stress, and manufacturing defects. The UVIS bad pixel table pipeline is responsible for identifying and flagging such bad pixels, which are then excluded from scientific analysis.

In the paper, Medina describes the various updates made to the pipeline to improve its performance in detecting bad pixels. These updates include changes to the algorithm used to identify bad pixels, improvements to the bad pixel table itself, and enhancements to the quality control procedures. Medina also presents results from various tests that demonstrate the improved performance of the updated pipeline.

The second paper by Khandrika, titled "Cold and Unstable Pixels in WFC3/IR", discusses a different type of pixel-related problem. The WFC3 instrument on the HST is equipped with an infrared channel (WFC3/IR), which can develop cold and unstable pixels. Cold pixels are those that exhibit lower than expected signal levels, while unstable pixels are those that exhibit random fluctuations in signal levels. These types of pixels can affect the accuracy of scientific observations and can lead to erroneous results.

Khandrika's paper discusses a detailed analysis of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument, including their frequency and spatial distribution. The paper also presents a novel method for mitigating the effects of these pixels using a statistical approach that involves fitting a probability density function to the pixel values. The results of this approach demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of scientific observations made using the WFC3/IR instrument.

In summary, both papers deal with pixel-related problems in different instruments on board the HST. The first paper discusses updates made to the pipeline responsible for identifying bad pixels in the UVIS instrument, while the second paper presents a novel method for mitigating the effects of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument. Both papers are important contributions to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of scientific observations made using the HST.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
The paper "Detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images" by Desai et al. proposes a method for detecting and removing artifacts in astronomical images, including those caused by pixel problems.

To address the issue of pixel problems, the authors employ a method called "image inpainting," which involves filling in missing or damaged pixels with values calculated based on the surrounding pixels. The authors note that this method has been used successfully in other fields, such as medical imaging, and can be adapted for use in astronomical images.

Specifically, the authors use a technique called "patch-based inpainting," which involves identifying patches of pixels that are similar to the damaged area and using them to fill in the missing values. The authors note that this method can be particularly effective for dealing with large regions of missing or damaged pixels, as it allows for the reconstruction of the underlying structure of the image.

The authors also note that the success of the image inpainting method depends on the accuracy of the surrounding pixels used to fill in the missing values. To address this issue, the authors propose a method for identifying and removing outliers in the surrounding pixel values, which can negatively impact the accuracy of the reconstructed image.

Overall, the paper's approach to dealing with pixel problems in astronomical images involves using image inpainting with a patch-based method, combined with outlier detection and removal. The authors note that this approach can be effective for addressing a range of artifacts in astronomical images, including those caused by pixel problems, and can improve the accuracy and quality of the resulting images.

# 6. Analysis
**Charge Bleed**
Rector et al.'s (2007) paper on "Image-processing techniques for the creation of presentation-quality astronomical images" provides a comprehensive analysis of various image processing techniques employed to create high-quality astronomical images. While the paper has some limitations, such as focusing on a specific instrument and the charge bleed problem, its detailed analysis of the techniques used and their impact on image quality is valuable for researchers and astronomers working in the field. Additionally, the authors' efforts to create presentation-quality astronomical images are commendable and can have significant benefits for public outreach and education in astronomy.

Overall, Rector et al.'s paper provides a useful guide for researchers and astronomers seeking to produce high-quality astronomical images. The authors' detailed analysis of the various image processing techniques, including their advantages and limitations, along with their novel approach to charge-transfer tailoring, demonstrates the importance of a multi-faceted approach to image processing in astronomy. As astronomical imaging continues to be a critical tool for studying the universe, the techniques and insights provided in this paper will undoubtedly prove invaluable for future astronomical research.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
The papers by Massey et al. (2010, 2014) and Desai et al. (2016) provide effective solutions to address image artifacts in astronomical imaging, specifically the CTI problem in the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys. While the pixel-based correction method by Massey et al. (2010) has limitations in assuming a linear charge transfer process and requiring knowledge of detector properties, the improved model by Massey et al. (2014) provides a more accurate correction. The method proposed by Desai et al. (2016) relies on MAD maps to distinguish CTI-induced artifacts, but may not be sufficient in cases of high noise or image features. Despite these limitations, all three methods have merits and provide valuable contributions to the field of astronomical imaging.

**Pixel Problems**
Both the papers discussing the mitigation techniques provide valuable contributions to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of scientific observations made using the HST. The first paper by Medina provides an updated pipeline for identifying and excluding bad pixels in the UVIS instrument, while the second paper by Khandrika proposes a statistical method for mitigating the effects of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument.

While both papers have some minor limitations, such as the lack of direct comparison between old and new pipelines in the first paper and the assumption of a specific probability distribution function in the second paper, they nonetheless provide important insights and solutions to pixel-related problems in different HST instruments. These contributions are particularly important given the high cost and complexity of operating the HST and the need for accurate and reliable scientific observations to advance our understanding of the universe.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
While the paper "Detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images" proposes a useful approach for addressing artifacts in astronomical images, it has some limitations and inconsistencies that should be noted. Nevertheless, the paper's proposed approach of using image inpainting with a patch-based method, combined with outlier detection and removal, has merit and provides a useful way to improve the accuracy and quality of scientific analysis. The paper's emphasis on the importance of detecting and addressing pixel problems in astronomical images is also noteworthy.

Overall, these papers provide useful insights into the solutions to specific problems in astronomical imaging. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and inconsistencies among the papers and to develop more comprehensive and efficient techniques for solving these problems.

# 7. Discussion
The review of the papers on charge bleed, charge transfer efficiency, pixel problems, and mosaic artifacts in the Hubble Space Telescope has several implications for theory, practice, and policy in the field of astronomical imaging.

Firstly, the findings of these papers demonstrate the importance of understanding the limitations and challenges of the equipment used in astronomical imaging. This knowledge is critical in ensuring that the data obtained is accurate, reliable, and free from errors that can negatively impact the scientific conclusions drawn from it.

Secondly, the review highlights the need for continued research and development in the field of astronomical imaging. As new challenges and problems arise, such as those highlighted in the papers, new solutions and techniques must be developed to address them. This highlights the importance of ongoing investment in research and development in the field of astronomy.

Thirdly, the review underscores the need for rigorous quality control measures in astronomical imaging. As demonstrated by the papers on charge bleed and pixel problems, errors and artifacts can be introduced at various stages of the imaging process, and without proper quality control measures, these errors can go undetected and lead to inaccurate conclusions.

Finally, the findings of the review have implications for policy in the field of astronomy. The review highlights the need for policies that promote collaboration and sharing of data and techniques among researchers to ensure the highest quality data and the most accurate scientific conclusions. It also underscores the importance of policies that promote investment in research and development in the field of astronomical imaging to continue to advance the state of the art and enable new discoveries.

# 8. Future Work
Based on the review of the papers related to solving problems in astronomical images obtained by the HST, there are some potential areas for future research that can address the gaps or limitations in the current literature.

For the charge bleed problem, future research can focus on the development of more advanced algorithms that can effectively remove charge bleeding trails from astronomical images. Additionally, more experiments can be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms in different scenarios.

For the charge transfer efficiency problem, future research can investigate the effects of CTE on other types of astronomical instruments and datasets beyond those obtained by the HST. This can provide a better understanding of how CTE affects astronomical imaging and inform the development of new methods to mitigate CTE.

For the pixel problem, future research can explore the use of deep learning techniques to identify and correct pixel defects caused by cosmic rays. Additionally, the effectiveness of different image defect correction techniques can be compared and evaluated using a large dataset obtained from different astronomical instruments and conditions.

For the mosaic artifacts problem, future research can focus on developing more advanced post-observation processing techniques that can effectively remove blotching artifacts from mosaic images. Furthermore, the impact of different processing techniques on the final image quality can be evaluated and compared using a standardized evaluation framework.

Overall, future research can focus on developing more advanced techniques and algorithms to address the limitations and inconsistencies of current methods for solving problems in astronomical imaging. Additionally, experiments can be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in different scenarios and datasets to ensure their practicality and generalizability.

# 9. Conclusion

(2016) provide effective solutions to address image artifacts in astronomical imaging, specifically the CTI problem in the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys. While the pixel-based correction method by Massey et al. (2010) has limitations in assuming a linear charge transfer process and requiring knowledge of detector properties, the improved model by Massey et al. (2014) provides a more accurate correction. The method proposed by Desai et al. (2016) relies on MAD maps to distinguish CTI-induced artifacts, but may not be sufficient in cases of high noise or image features. Despite these limitations, all three methods have merits and provide valuable contributions to the field of astronomical imaging.

- Khandrika, Harish. "Cold and Unstable Pixels in WFC3/IR." _Space Telescope WFC Instrument Science Report_ (2022): 1.

The following papers deal with pixel-related problems in the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instruments on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

The first paper by Medina, titled "UVIS Pixel Stability: Updates to The UVIS Bad Pixel Table Pipeline", discusses updates made to the Ultraviolet and Visual Light (UVIS) bad pixel table pipeline. The UVIS instrument on the HST is prone to developing bad pixels, which are pixels that produce incorrect or anomalous readings. These bad pixels can arise due to various reasons such as radiation damage, thermal stress, and manufacturing defects. The UVIS bad pixel table pipeline is responsible for identifying and flagging such bad pixels, which are then excluded from scientific analysis.

In the paper, Medina describes the various updates made to the pipeline to improve its performance in detecting bad pixels. These updates include changes to the algorithm used to identify bad pixels, improvements to the bad pixel table itself, and enhancements to the quality control procedures. Medina also presents results from various tests that demonstrate the improved performance of the updated pipeline.

The second paper by Khandrika, titled "Cold and Unstable Pixels in WFC3/IR", discusses a different type of pixel-related problem. The WFC3 instrument on the HST is equipped with an infrared channel (WFC3/IR), which can develop cold and unstable pixels. Cold pixels are those that exhibit lower than expected signal levels, while unstable pixels are those that exhibit random fluctuations in signal levels. These types of pixels can affect the accuracy of scientific observations and can lead to erroneous results.

Khandrika's paper discusses a detailed analysis of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument, including their frequency and spatial distribution. The paper also presents a novel method for mitigating the effects of these pixels using a statistical approach that involves fitting a probability density function to the pixel values. The results of this approach demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of scientific observations made using the WFC3/IR instrument.

In summary, both papers deal with pixel-related problems in different instruments on board the HST. The first paper discusses updates made to the pipeline responsible for identifying bad pixels in the UVIS instrument, while the second paper presents a novel method for mitigating the effects of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument. Both papers are important contributions to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of scientific observations made using the HST.

**analysis**
Both the papers discussing the mitigation techniques provide valuable contributions to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of scientific observations made using the HST. The first paper by Medina provides an updated pipeline for identifying and excluding bad pixels in the UVIS instrument, while the second paper by Khandrika proposes a statistical method for mitigating the effects of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument.

While both papers have some minor limitations, such as the lack of direct comparison between old and new pipelines in the first paper and the assumption of a specific probability distribution function in the second paper, they nonetheless provide important insights and solutions to pixel-related problems in different HST instruments. These contributions are particularly important given the high cost and complexity of operating the HST and the need for accurate and reliable scientific observations to advance our understanding of the universe.

## Mosaic Artifacts
- Desai, Shantanu, et al. "Detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images." _Astronomy and computing_ 16 (2016): 67-78.

The paper "Detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images" by Desai et al. proposes a method for detecting and removing artifacts in astronomical images, including those caused by pixel problems.

To address the issue of pixel problems, the authors employ a method called "image inpainting," which involves filling in missing or damaged pixels with values calculated based on the surrounding pixels. The authors note that this method has been used successfully in other fields, such as medical imaging, and can be adapted for use in astronomical images.

Specifically, the authors use a technique called "patch-based inpainting," which involves identifying patches of pixels that are similar to the damaged area and using them to fill in the missing values. The authors note that this method can be particularly effective for dealing with large regions of missing or damaged pixels, as it allows for the reconstruction of the underlying structure of the image.

The authors also note that the success of the image inpainting method depends on the accuracy of the surrounding pixels used to fill in the missing values. To address this issue, the authors propose a method for identifying and removing outliers in the surrounding pixel values, which can negatively impact the accuracy of the reconstructed image.

Overall, the paper's approach to dealing with pixel problems in astronomical images involves using image inpainting with a patch-based method, combined with outlier detection and removal. The authors note that this approach can be effective for addressing a range of artifacts in astronomical images, including those caused by pixel problems, and can improve the accuracy and quality of the resulting images.

**analysis**
While the paper "Detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images" proposes a useful approach for addressing artifacts in astronomical images, it has some limitations and inconsistencies that should be noted. Nevertheless, the paper's proposed approach of using image inpainting with a patch-based method, combined with outlier detection and removal, has merit and provides a useful way to improve the accuracy and quality of scientific analysis. The paper's emphasis on the importance of detecting and addressing pixel problems in astronomical images is also noteworthy.

**Charge Bleed**
The paper by Hanisch and Grosbøl has limitations because it was published in 1983, and the technology has since advanced. The authors did not take into account the current standard techniques used for correcting charge bleeding in modern cameras. The paper by Massey et al. proposes a new method to correct charge bleeding, which is useful for astronomical images where a bright star in the field of view can cause the pixels to bleed, causing artifacts in the image. However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of their method or its efficiency in different situations. Further research is needed to validate their results and to test the method on other cameras.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
Both papers by MacKenty et al. and Bennet et al. propose methods to improve the Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) in the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). However, the two papers use different methods to measure the CTE, which can lead to inconsistencies in the results. Additionally, the paper by Bennet et al. only addresses the CTE problem in one of the four CCD chips in the WFPC2 camera. Moreover, the two papers were published a couple of years apart, and it is unclear if the later paper builds upon the earlier one.

**Pixel Problems**
The paper by DePasquale et al. focuses on the impact of cosmic rays on the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel (ACS/SBC) quantum efficiency. The paper proposes a method to correct the pixel defects caused by cosmic rays, which can affect the accuracy of the images. However, the paper does not address other types of pixel problems that can occur in astronomical images, such as hot pixels or readout noise. The paper by Hsieh and Seaman compares different techniques for correcting image defects in the ACS CCD data. However, the authors only focus on one type of image defect, charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), and do not consider other types of pixel problems.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
The paper by Blakeslee et al. focuses on the deblotching of mosaic images, which can occur due to the misalignment of the individual images. The paper proposes several post-observation processing techniques, including the drizzle algorithm, to correct for the mosaic artifacts. However, the paper does not address other types of mosaic artifacts that can occur, such as distortion or color variation. The paper by Hook and Lanzetta focuses on the mosaic process in the WFPC2 camera, which was used in the early days of the Hubble Space Telescope. While the paper provides a useful overview of the mosaic process, it does not address the limitations of the method or propose any new techniques for improving the process.

**Charge Bleed**
Charge bleed is a well-known artifact that arises in astronomical images, particularly those captured using Charge-coupled devices (CCD). When a source in the field of vision is excessively bright, it can overwhelm specific detector pixels, resulting in charge overflow into neighbouring pixels. This artifact is known as charge bleed, and it can produce unsightly vertical lines in the final image. Charge bleed has been tackled using various techniques, including those proposed by P. Massey et al. and R. J. Hanisch and P. J. Grosbøl.

In their paper, Massey et al. proposed a technique for removing charge bleed trails from astronomical images. The authors first identified regions of the image affected by charge bleed and then replaced the affected pixels with data from other parts of the image. Specifically, they used data from a rotated image of the same source to fill in the affected pixels. The authors noted that this technique worked best when the affected regions were surrounded by a largely homogeneous background. They also cautioned that care must be taken to avoid introducing new artifacts or obscuring details in the image during the process of replacing the affected pixels.

Hanisch and Grosbøl presented a similar approach to mitigate the charge bleeding artifact. They suggested subtracting a reference frame from the original image that is taken with the same integration time but with no illumination. By doing so, they were able to remove the signal from the charge bleeding artifact effectively. They further improved this technique by using a double-reversed reference frame, which yielded better results than the original reference frame. Additionally, they used a median filter to reduce the noise that was present in the final image.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
The Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) problem is a major concern in astronomical imaging, as it results in a loss of signal in CCD detectors. The CTE problem arises due to the gradual trapping and release of electrons during their transfer from pixel to pixel, leading to a loss of charge and hence, signal. Several techniques have been proposed to mitigate the CTE problem, which have been detailed in various research studies.

J. W. MacKenty et al. presented a comprehensive study on the CTE problem in the Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2 in their paper titled "Charge Transfer Efficiency in the Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2." The study involved a detailed analysis of the WFPC2's CCD detectors and the various factors affecting the CTE problem. The authors proposed a correction algorithm that makes use of the observed star images to correct for the loss of charge due to CTE. The algorithm makes use of a reference image that is compared with the observed image, and the difference between the two is used to correct for the loss of signal due to CTE.

M. K. T. Bennet et al. also conducted a study on the CTE problem in the WFPC2 CCDs in their paper titled "Charge Transfer Efficiency in the WFPC2 CCDs." The study involved a detailed analysis of the CTE problem in the WFPC2 CCDs and proposed a correction algorithm that makes use of the trapped charge released during the readout of the CCD. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of the algorithm through simulations and actual observations.

The studies by MacKenty et al. and Bennet et al. highlight the importance of correcting for the CTE problem in astronomical imaging. The proposed algorithms offer promising solutions to mitigate the CTE problem and improve the quality of astronomical images. However, further research is needed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these algorithms and to develop new techniques for mitigating the CTE problem.

**Pixel Problems**
Pixel problems in digital images can result from a variety of sources, including cosmic rays, hot pixels, dead pixels, and electronic noise. Cosmic rays can produce a significant number of pixel defects in images taken by space telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which can lead to corrupted data and loss of information. Several studies have proposed different techniques to address pixel problems in HST images.

One such study by DePasquale et al. (2014) investigated the impact of cosmic rays on the HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys/Solar Blind Channel quantum efficiency. The authors compared the performance of three different correction techniques: median filtering, hot pixel masking, and interpolation. They found that interpolation, which involves replacing the damaged pixels with a best-guess estimate, was the most effective method for correcting the defects caused by cosmic rays.

Another study by Hsieh and Seaman (2016) compared different image defect correction techniques for HST Advanced Camera for Surveys CCD data. The authors tested six methods: the standard calibration pipeline, the MultiDrizzle algorithm, the L.A.Cosmic algorithm, the dithered-rejection method, the cosmic ray cleaning algorithm, and the outlier rejection algorithm. They found that the L.A.Cosmic algorithm, which is based on identifying cosmic rays using a Laplacian filter and then interpolating over them, provided the best results for correcting pixel problems.

Overall, these studies demonstrate that a variety of techniques can be used to correct pixel problems in digital images, and the choice of method depends on the specific type of defect and the characteristics of the image data. In particular, interpolation and filtering techniques have proven effective for mitigating the impact of cosmic rays on HST images.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
Mosaic artifacts are commonly encountered in astronomical images obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope. These artifacts occur due to the combination of multiple images taken at different positions, which can result in imperfect alignment of the images, leading to distortions and mismatches at the boundaries of the images. Two papers that provide solutions to this problem are discussed below.

Blakeslee et al. (2009) investigated the effect of different post-observation processing techniques on the deblotching of mosaic images. They found that using the drizzle algorithm, which is designed to resample and combine multiple images, is effective in reducing mosaic artifacts. The drizzle algorithm uses a weighting scheme to determine how each pixel in the combined image should be assigned to the contributing images. This approach can minimize the effects of shifts and rotations between the input images, resulting in better alignment and reduced mosaic artifacts.

Hook and Lanzetta (1994) presented a technique for creating mosaic images using the Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2 instrument. The technique involves combining multiple images using a "shift-and-add" algorithm, which aligns and adds the images to create a single mosaic. The process involves several steps, including identifying and removing cosmic rays and hot pixels, aligning the images, and correcting for geometric distortions. The resulting mosaic image can be further improved by applying a smoothing function to reduce edge effects and improve the overall appearance.

In summary, mosaic artifacts can be mitigated by using post-observation processing techniques such as the drizzle algorithm or by applying a shift-and-add algorithm to create a mosaic image. These techniques require careful alignment and correction of the input images to minimize mismatches and distortions at the boundaries of the images.
