Respected Ma'am,

Hope this email finds you well. My name is **Nayan Ranjan Das**, and I am excited to work under your guidance for the summer internship at CSIR National Physics Laboratory. 

Firstly, I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with some additional details regarding the **domain or focus area of the internship**. I have a general idea of what to expect, but having a clearer understanding of the particular field will allow me to prepare better. If there are any specific projects or tasks that I might be involved in, I'd love to hear about them.

Additionally, I wanted to confirm the details for our first meeting, which is scheduled for this coming Monday i.e. **29th May, 2023**. Could you please let me know the exact location and the time I should arrive?

I truly appreciate your assistance in providing me with these crucial details. Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best Regards,
