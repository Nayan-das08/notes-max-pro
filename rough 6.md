## guide
- a main google account (**nayanrdas02**) for my identity in terms of google. this is to be used for android log in, google photos, an email address i can provide for official purposes like tax, banks, etc 
- a google account (**nayanpcstudy**) for signing into services that i need, but do not wish to involve my official gmail id with it, like social media, streaming platforms, spotify, hackathon registrations, college registration, gmail to be provided to peers and colleagues for communication, etc. these are tasks i need, but do not want to include with the official id 
- a google account (**new account**) for signing into sites and apps and services which i need for the time being, just to avail their services and forget about them, they are just temporary sign ins as they are only to be used for viewing their content, thats all, even the data need not be saved for those accounts at these platforms 
- use any of the google account for cloud storage, choose an account from one of these which is supposed to have the least space occupied by the emails. so that the maximum of the space can be used by the google drive services. chose among the already created account instead of creating a new account.
	- currently using **nayanpcstudy**, can be changed to the **new account** any time
