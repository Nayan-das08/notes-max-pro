- economics
	- study of how society managing scarce resources
## ten principles of economics

1. **people make tradeoffs**
	- having more money to buy stuffs requires working for longer hours, which leaves less time for leisure
	- efficiency vs equality
		- efficiency: when society gets the most from its scarce resources
			- best when goods produced by those who are cost effective
			- best when consumed by those who value it the most
		- equality: when prosperity is distributed uniformly among society's members
			- comes in the way of efficiency
			- but is important for society
			- to get greater equality, redistribute resources from rich to poor. this reduces incentive to work and produce, shrinks the size of economic pie
				- if tax is more, work/output will be less due to less incentive, thus 
2. **cost of something is what you give up to get it**
	- all decisions require some cost
	- opportunity cost: potential benefit one forgoes when choosing one option over the other
		- if resources are spent on an activity, then opportunity cost is the benefit one could have gained when choosing the next best alternative activity
3. **rational people think at the margin**
	- people make decisions based on the additional benefits and costs of a small, incremental change in a current situation
	- often referred to as marginal analysis.
4. **people respond to incentives**
	- incentive: prospect of a reward or punishment
		- eg: when gas prices increases, consumers look into alternative fuel vehicles
5. **trade can make everyone better off**
	- fundamental concept in theory of comparative advantage
	- one specializes in producing a good more efficiently than other goods
	- when different parties of diff comp adv trade, both can benefit
	- rather than being *self-sufficent*, one can specialize in producing one good and exchange it for other goods
6. **markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity**
	- organized economic activity
		- what goods to produce
		- how to produce them
		- how much of each to produce
		- who gets them
	- market is a medium which facilitates transaction between buyer and seller
	- market economy allocates resources through decentralized decisions of many households and firms 
	- interaction of buyers and sellers determines prices
	- price reflects the good's value to buyers and cost of production
	- price guides the self interested households and firms to make decisions that maximize society's economic well being
7. **govt can sometimes improve market outcomes**
	- market failure
		- when market fails to allocate society's resources efficiently
		- caused by 
			- externalities: when production or consumption of a good impacts third parties
			- market power: a single buyer or seller has substantial influence on price (monopoly)
		- govt can alter market outcome to promote *equality*
8. **a country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services**
	- most important factor of living standards: *productivity*
