## Software Quality Assurance (SQA)
- process which assures that all software engg process, methods, activities, and work items are monitored and checked against defined std
- std - ISO 9000, CMMI moel, ISO 15504
- incorporates all software dev processes, from defining requirements to coding until release
- prime goal: ensure quality

## SQA plan
- purpose section
- reference
- software config management
- problem reporting and corrective action
- tools tech and methods
- code control
- records
- testing

## quality assurance activities
1. create an SQA management plan
2. setting the checkpoints
3. apply SE techniques
4. executing formal technical review
5. multi testing strategy
6. enforcing process adherence
7. auditing
8. reviewing
9. code inspection
10. design inspection
11. simulation
12. functional testing
13. standardization
14. static analysis
15. walkthrough
16. path testing
17. stress testing
18. six sigma / total quality management

## inspection
- find problem at the earliest possible point in the software
