The author Kim, Liu Z.[5] provided an overview of breakthroughs in fire detection systems throughout the last decade. They focused on numerous promising monitoring technologies (e.g., computer vision system, decentralised optical fibre thermal sensor, and so on), signal processing and surveillance technologies (for example, real-time automation over the Internet), and embedded fire detection systems. 

The author Kim, Liu Z.[5] provided an overview of breakthroughs in fire detection systems throughout the last decade. The various monitoring systems discussed included physical sensor technologies like detectors for heat, smoke, flame and gas which have high tendency for flagging false positives; signal processing solutions for surveillance which involves computer vision technologies for monitoring via video and other media; and embedded fire detection systems, where the system has all the control to take decisions based on data collected in real-time and communicate with other components of the system to raise alert. Another important argument raised against embedded systems is that emergency situations may crash other systems, ultimately highlighting a drawback which needs to be considered.

Traditional fire alarm systems used physical sensors to find fires, which led to the creation of false alarms, as was addressed by Celik et al. [6]. The example of a person smoking and the creation of an alert is highlighted. Computer vision technology was used, which helped to bridge typical gaps in learning and emerged as a trustworthy platform for picture detection.

The drawback of false alarms in physical sensor based alarm system is addressed thoroughly by Celik et. al. [6]. The example of a person smoking and the creation of an alert is highlighted. To tackle this issue, computer vision technology is used along with the stand-alone system to reduce false alarms. The algorithm employed consists of two parts. The first part is fire colour modelling where the model is trained to learn the fire pixels by testing on video sequences of different types of fire. For this, the model requires RGB data  to be converted into CIE $L*a*b*$ format. The second part is the moving pixel detection which involves analysing the pattern in which selected fire pixels move throughout the stationary frame. This image processing, although yielding good results is a computationally complex task, and this is when the smoke is not considered for early warning signs.

New developments in clip generated fire detection were given by the authors Ã‡etin et al. [7]. For fire detection, surveillance systems and the unique intent of infrared surveillance cameras can be used. Authors also discussed the importance of sophisticated video processing tools to detect and investigate uncontrolled flame propagation




The goal of this paper is to provide a summary of the work done on video fire detection. In general, this work deals with the analysis of digital signals for the detection of threats or punctures. The work involves many steps, but all of it worked together to create a working video fire detection system.

The first step in this process is to process the digital signal. This means taking into account the quality of the signal, the its source, and any noise. Next, there is a step where the digital signal is processed so that it includes all free space on both sides of the fire. This space is filled with data (usually Bits wide), which is processed further by a Checker box (CBO) which takes into account the size of the data set. Finally
