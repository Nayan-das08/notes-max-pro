# Introduction
Land degradation poses a significant environmental challenge with far-reaching implications for ecosystems, food security, and human well-being. The monitoring and assessment of land cover changes play a crucial role in addressing this pressing issue. This progress report presents an overview of our project titled "Multispectral Land Cover Analysis and Change Detection for Assessing Environmental Dynamics," which is dedicated to leveraging cutting-edge technology and analytical methodologies to investigate and detect land degradation within the Indian subcontinent.

The core objective of our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of time-series multispectral remote sensing data obtained from reliable sources, covering the expansive landscape of the Indian subcontinent. By analyzing these datasets over multiple time periods, our aim is to identify and assess changes in land cover, with a particular focus on detecting land degradation.

### Methodology Overview
Our methodology comprises a well-structured approach to achieving our research objectives:

1. **Data Acquisition:** We have meticulously acquired multispectral remote sensing data from reputable sources, ensuring that it encompasses the Indian subcontinent and spans multiple temporal windows.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** To enhance data quality and ensure spatial and spectral consistency, we have performed radiometric and geometric corrections on the acquired data, thereby eliminating noise and enhancing its accuracy.

3. **Image Registration:** Registering multispectral images from different time periods is vital for accurate pixel-to-pixel alignment, facilitating precise change detection and analysis.

4. **Land Cover Classification:** Employing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised classification, we have classified land cover classes within the multispectral images.

5. **Change Detection Analysis:** Change detection techniques such as image differencing and principal component analysis are applied to compare the classified land cover maps from different time periods.

6. **Accuracy Assessment:** To ensure the reliability and precision of our findings, we have rigorously evaluated the change detection results using ground truth data and validation points.

7. **Environmental Dynamics Analysis:** Our research goes beyond mere change detection; we delve into the environmental dynamics of the Indian subcontinent. This analysis encompasses land degradation, urbanization, changes in water bodies, and shifts in agricultural patterns.

8. **Interface Development:** To make our project findings accessible and actionable, we are developing an intuitive interface that will enable policymakers, researchers, and the general public to interact with the results. 

9. **Interpretation and Conclusion:** Finally, we will interpret the results of our analysis and draw meaningful conclusions regarding the state of land degradation in the Indian subcontinent. We will discuss the implications of our findings for environmental conservation and sustainable land use.

This project assumes particular importance given the limited research conducted on land cover changes within India. By shedding light on environmental dynamics, including land degradation and related transformations, we aim to provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of land degradation in the Indian subcontinent. The findings from this project are poised to serve as an indispensable resource for environmentalists, policymakers, and stakeholders. Armed with these insights, they can make informed decisions and implement effective measures to promote sustainable land use and environmental conservation. In an era where land degradation continues to be a global concern, our research aspires to pave the way for proactive and targeted land management strategies, safeguarding the natural resources of the Indian subcontinent.

# Literature Review
### 1. Multi-temporal Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection for Dedza District of Malawi using Geospatial Techniques
The paper titled “Multi-temporal Analysis of Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection for Dedza District of Malawi using Geospatial Techniques” is a study that analyzed the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in Dedza district of Malawi for the years **1991, 2001, and 2015** using remote sensing and GIS. The study used both supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms on each image and achieved an overall accuracy of **91.86%**.

The results revealed that forest land, water bodies, wetlands, and agricultural land drastically declined while built-up areas and barren land substantially increased between 1991 and 2015. The long-term annual rate of change declined for water bodies from 5.54% ha-1 to 1.74% ha-1 within the period of study. Likewise, the forest land, agricultural land, and built-up area experienced increased annual rates of change from 1.71% ha-1 to 1.94% ha-1, 0.02% ha-1 to 0.11% ha-1, and 7.22% ha-1 to 9.80% ha-1 respectively.

Post-classification comparison of the classified images based on the transition matrix indicated that approximately 61.48% of the total forest land in 1991 was converted to barren land in 2015 while about 2.70% of agricultural land in 1991 has been converted to built-up land in 2015. This study provides reliable LULC data which captured the extent and rate of land use changes that has occurred in the Dedza district of Malawi for the period ranging from 1991-2015. It is believed that the trends identified in this study would be useful in guiding planners and decision-makers of land management and policy decisions geared towards a more sustainable natural resource management strategy in the Dedza district and other districts of similar setting. It is recommended that a study be undertaken to establish the apparent socio-economic and spatial drivers of the LULC changes between 1991 and 2015 over Dedza district of Malawi

### 2. Using Landsat satellite data for assessing the land use and land cover change in Kashmir valley
The paper titled “Using Landsat satellite data for assessing the land use and land cover change in Kashmir valley” is a study that examined the land use and land cover changes in the Kashmir valley between the time periods from **1992–2001–2015** using a set of compatible moderate resolution Landsat satellite imageries. The study adopted a supervised approach with maximum likelihood classifier for the classification and generation of LULC maps for the selected time periods.

The results revealed that there have been substantial changes in the land use and cover during the chosen time periods. In general, three land use and land cover change patterns were observed in the study area: (1) consistent increase of the area under marshy, built-up, barren, plantation, and shrubs; (2) continuous decrease in agriculture and water; (3) decrease (1992–2001) and increase (2001–2015) in forest and pasture classes. In terms of the area under each LULC category, most significant changes have been observed in agriculture (-), plantation (+), built-up (+), and water (-); however, with reference to percent change within each class, the maximum variability was recorded in built-up (**198.45%**), plantation (**87.98%**), pasture (**-71%**), water (**-48%**) and agriculture (**-28.85%**).

The massive land transformation is largely driven by anthropogenic actions and has been mostly adverse in nature, giving rise to multiple environmental issues in the ecologically sensitive Kashmir valley. The study provides valuable insights into the land use and land cover changes in the Kashmir valley over a period of time and can be useful for environmental conservation, resource management, land use planning, and sustainable development.

### 3. Deep learning-based object detection and geographic coordinate estimation system for GeoTiff imagery
The paper titled “Deep learning-based object detection and geographic coordinate estimation system for GeoTiff imagery” is a research that focuses on applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect objects and estimate the geographic coordinate of airplanes, ships, and cars in **GeoTiff images**. The system prototype was tested to measure the accuracy and precision for object detection, and a **Mean Absolute Error** (MAE) analysis was done to measure object coordinate estimation performance.

The accuracy and precision for object detection of the system prototype are **81.05%** and **93.29%**, respectively. The system has MAE values which vary from **0.000012°** to **0.000034°** for object coordinate estimation. This research proposed a system for detecting and estimating the coordinate of specific objects in GeoTiff images using CNN, which has been proven to result in good performance to detect objects from aerial and satellite imagery.

# Other Studies
1. **STAC Catalog**: 
The **SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)** is a specification that provides a common language to describe geospatial information, so it can be more easily worked with, indexed, and discovered. The STAC Catalog is a simple, flexible JSON file of links that provides a structure to organize and browse STAC Items. A series of best practices helps make recommendations for creating real-world STAC Catalogs.

2. **GeoJSON**: 
GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. It is based on the JSON format. The features include points (therefore addresses and locations), line strings (therefore streets, highways, and boundaries), polygons (countries, provinces, tracts of land), and multi-part collections of these types.

3. **GeoTIFF**: 
GeoTIFF is a public domain metadata standard that allows georeferencing information to be embedded within a TIFF file. The potential additional information includes map projection, coordinate systems, ellipsoids, datums, and everything else necessary to establish the exact spatial reference for the file. The GeoTIFF format is fully compliant with TIFF 6.0, so software incapable of reading and interpreting the specialized metadata will still be able to open a GeoTIFF format file.
