### week 1
- Studied NTP
	- from RFC-5905
- studied attacks
	- DDoS attack
	- investigated different mitigation techniques
- python script to 
	- retrieve time synchronization NTP information from server
	- sync devices to NTP server
	- get a list of all NTP servers
		- find a source

### week 2
- attacks
	- MITM attack
	- Replay attack
	- Delay attack
	- investigate different mitigation techniques
- python script 
	- get a list of all NTP servers
		- use web scraping techniques to extract the list
	- separate the list is terms of Stratum 1 and 2
	- collect NTP information for all the servers

### week 3
- troubleshooted the python script for send and receiving NTP requests. 
- streamlined the process of saving to CSV file
- performed statistical analysis on data regarding responses from NTP servers
- cleaned the NTP response data of outliers
- preprocessed the NTP attack dataset
- explored initial models on NTP attack dataset

### week 4
- performed further preprocessing on the NTP attack dataset
- separated data of interest from various attack datasets from the same source
- performed training and testing on several models and finalized an LSTM-based model for classification
- obtained evaluation metrics for the model on various testing sets
- compiled the project report with all the results and included detailed discussions about the methodologies and outcomes involved
