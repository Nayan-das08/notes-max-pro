## What is an Expert System?
- Expert systems are computer programs that mimic human expertise in a specific domain.

- They use knowledge and rules to solve problems and make decisions.

- Examples of expert systems include medical diagnosis systems, financial planning systems, and legal decision-making systems.

- Expert systems are important in various fields as they can provide accurate and consistent advice, even in complex situations.

## Architecture of Expert System R1

- Expert System R1 has a modular architecture that consists of four main components: Input/output module, Rule Base, Working Memory, and Inference Engine.

- The Input/output module is responsible for receiving input from the user and displaying output.

- The Rule Base contains the knowledge and rules that the expert system uses to make decisions.

- The Working Memory is where the expert system stores information about the problem it is solving.

- The Inference Engine is the part of the system that performs the reasoning and decision-making process.

## Working of Expert System R1

- Expert System R1 uses rule-based reasoning to make decisions.

- The inference engine applies the rules in the Rule Base to the information in the Working Memory to arrive at a conclusion.

- Expert System R1 can use forward or backward chaining to infer new information and make decisions.

## Knowledge Representation in Expert System R1

- Expert System R1 represents knowledge using rules.

- The knowledge acquisition process involves capturing knowledge from experts and encoding it as rules.

- The knowledge base contains the facts and information that the expert system uses to solve problems, while the rule base contains the rules that the expert system uses to reason about the facts.
