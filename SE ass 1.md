Module 1 and 2
Assigned: February 15, 2023
Deadline: Friday, February 27, 2023

1. describe the working of waterfall mode; with at least its 3 advantages. Design and explain any real world scenario of Software Development where the waterfall model will not be suitable as compare to other software life cycle models
2. Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a base for managing the development of following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed.
	1. a sys to control antilock braking in a car
	2. a virtual reality sys to support software maintenance
	3. a uni accounting sys that replaces the existing system
3. Suggest some advantages and disadvantages of the approach to the process assessment and improvement that is embodied in the SEI's (Software Engineering Institute's) capability maturity model (CMM).
4. Discuss the reasons for which it can be difficult to introduce the agile methods into large companies.
5. A colleague who is very good programmer produces software with a low number of defects but consistently ignores the organizational quality standards. How should her managers react to this behaviour?

6. For some program having no of unique operators n1=20, N1=53, no of unique operands n2=40, N2=38, compute
	1. program length
	2. volume
	3. level
	4. effort and time
7. What do you mean by a good software design? Also discuss the criteria for a software design to enhance the quality of software.
8. Compute the function point value for a project with the following info domain characteristics
	1. no of user inputs=45
	2. outputs=32
	3. enquiries=18
	4. files=9
	5. ext inteface=8
	- Assume that all complexity adjustment values are moderate
9. Discuss the differences bw object oriented design and function oriented design
10. Define the term Software Design. Also discuss the coupling in the context of software design. For a good design the modules should have low coupling, why?
11. For a software of size 35000 LOC that is to be developed using the organic made, the cost drives assessed have been as
	1. LOW - RELY, TOOL, MODP
	2. NOMINAL - DATA, TIME, STOR, VIRT, TURN
	3. VERY HIGH - CPLX
	4. others could not be assessed

| model        | a   | b    | c   | d    |
| ------------ | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| basic        | 2.4 | 1.05 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| intermediate | 3.2 | 1.05 | 2.5 | 0.38 |

estimate the effort and calendar time using the basic COCOMO model and the intermediate COCOMO model.

12. What is risk? Is it economical to do risk management? What is the effect of this activity on the overall cost of the project?
13. Compute the function point value for a project with the following info domain characteristics
	1. inputs = 24
	2. outputs = 65
	3. enquiries = 12
	4. files = 12
	5. external interfaces = 4
	6. Assume that all complexity adjustment values are moderate
14. Define the concept of Module Cohesion. Briefly explain different types of cohesion
15. Explain the basic COCOMO model. Suppose that a project was estimated to be 400 KLOC. Calculate the effort and development time for each of the three modes i.e. organic, semi-dethatched and embedded.

| software project | a   | b    | c   | d    |
| ---------------- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| organic          | 2.4 | 1.05 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| semidetatched    | 3.0 | 1.12 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| embedded         | 3.6 | 1.20 | 2.5 | 0.32 |
