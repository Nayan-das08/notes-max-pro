# Intro
- for NLP, there are 3 stages
	- **Lexical Processing**
		- you will be required to do text preprocessing and text cleaning
		- steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, correcting the spellings, etc
	- **syntax processing**
		- you will be required to extract more meaning from the content by using ... instead of just blankly looking at what the words are 
		- will be looking at the syntactic structure, i.e., the grammar of the language to understand what the meaning is 
	- **semantic processing**
		- above processings do not suffice when it comes to advance NLP processing such as language translation, chatbot, etc.
