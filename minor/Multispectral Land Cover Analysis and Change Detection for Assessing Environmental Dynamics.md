- Shruti - objective
	- land cover analysis
	- change detection analysis
	- novelty
		- existing such projects for india are only govt. - not accessible (data)
		- not using ai / segmentation techniques
	- monitoring dashboard
		- final proposed implementation - outcome
		- web based (Utkarsh)
- Nayan - Lit rev
