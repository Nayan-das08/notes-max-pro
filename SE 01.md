## prototyping model
- aelirer models needed definite designs
- they lack customer interaction
- enter, this one
- cinverns the approval of customers
- can;t move fwd till customer is satisdaied
- time consuming
- 4 types
	- throwaway
		- prepare something, dont like, throw, create from scratch again
	- evolutionary
		- dont throw, modify/refine
- pahses
	- initial req
	- design and eval
		- prototyping
		- customer eval
		- review and updation
		- design
	- dev
	- test
	- deploy/maintain

## spiral model
- concerns risk identification, analysis, prioritization, handling
- simple figure = 4 quads
	- req analysis
	- coding and tesitn
	- eval
	- risk analysis and planning
		- has to be done parallely along with all the phases

## interative model
- 3 iterations consisting of phases
- modular
- dont move till one module/iteration is satisfactory

## incremental model
- worst (more than waterfall? ou yea)
- do all phases $n$ times
- lot of deployment time
