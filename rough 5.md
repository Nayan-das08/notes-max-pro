# EDA
EDA, or Exploratory Data Analysis, is an important initial step in data analysis. EDA involves the process of reviewing and analyzing data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data. The main goal of EDA is to gain a better understanding of the data and to identify any potential issues or anomalies that may affect the results of subsequent analyses.

Some common techniques used in EDA include:

1. **Data visualization**: Using graphs, charts, and other visualizations to explore and analyze data.
2. **Descriptive statistics**: Using summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles to describe the distribution of the data.
3. **Data cleaning**: Identifying and correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the data.
4. **Data transformation**: Converting data into a different format or scale to make it easier to analyze or visualize.
5. **Dimensionality reduction**: Reducing the number of variables in a dataset while preserving important information.
6. **Outlier detection**: Identifying and handling outliers or extreme values in the data.

The methodology of the research paper "Identifying Dysgraphia Using Deep Learning" is a carefully designed and executed process that aims to develop an accurate and reliable deep learning model for identifying dysgraphia. The first step of the methodology involved the collection of a diverse set of handwriting samples from individuals both with and without dysgraphia. 

Due to the lack of publicly available datasets on dysgraphic handwriting, the authors of this study collected their own samples. To classify these samples, the authors relied on their own understanding of the classification criteria as well as input from their peers. This approach allowed the authors to create a dataset that was tailored to their specific research goals and objectives. However, it is important to acknowledge that this subjective approach to classification may introduce some degree of variability or bias into the dataset. To address this limitation, the authors carefully documented their classification criteria and procedures to ensure transparency and replicability of their methods.

Once the data was collected, it underwent a rigorous preprocessing phase to ensure that the input to the deep learning model is in a suitable format. The images were rescaled using a scaling factor of 1/255 to convert the pixel values from 0-255 to a range of 0-1, which is a common normalization technique used in image processing. This step helps to reduce the impact of variations in lighting and contrast in the images.

In order to assess the performance of the deep learning model, a portion of the data (10%) was set aside for validation purposes. To improve the robustness of the model, data augmentation was performed by randomly flipping some of the images horizontally. This helped to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent the model from overfitting on the training data.

The deep learning model architecture consisted of a sequence of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a series of fully connected layers. The convolutional layers learned features from the handwriting images, while the pooling layers reduced the dimensionality of the output. The fully connected layers combined these features to generate the final output. The model was trained using Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss function, and three evaluation metrics: accuracy, recall, and AUC.

To prevent overfitting, the model was trained for only 20 epochs with early stopping using ReduceLROnPlateau. This technique reduces the learning rate of the optimizer when the validation loss stops improving, which can help the model to converge to a better solution. The model achieved a high training accuracy of 99.11%, indicating that it had learned to identify patterns in the data that distinguish individuals with dysgraphia from those without.

Finally, the performance of the model was evaluated using a classification report that compared the true labels of the test data against the predicted labels from the model. This report provides valuable insights into the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model, which are crucial metrics for evaluating its effectiveness.

In conclusion, the methodology of this research paper is a comprehensive and well-executed process that involves careful data collection, preprocessing, data augmentation, model development, training, and evaluation. The results demonstrate that the model is effective in identifying dysgraphia and has the potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings.

# methodology
The methodology of the research paper "Identifying Dysgraphia Using Deep Learning" is a carefully designed and executed process that aims to develop an accurate and reliable deep learning model for identifying dysgraphia. The first step of the methodology involved the collection of a diverse set of handwriting samples from individuals both with and without dysgraphia. 

Due to the lack of publicly available datasets on dysgraphic handwriting, the authors of this study collected their own samples. To classify these samples, the authors relied on their own understanding of the classification criteria as well as input from their peers. This approach allowed the authors to create a dataset that was tailored to their specific research goals and objectives. However, it is important to acknowledge that this subjective approach to classification may introduce some degree of variability or bias into the dataset. To address this limitation, the authors carefully documented their classification criteria and procedures to ensure transparency and replicability of their methods.

Once the data was collected, it underwent a rigorous pre-processing phase to ensure that the input to the deep learning model is in a suitable format. The images were rescaled using a scaling factor of 1/255 to convert the pixel values from 0-255 to a range of 0-1, which is a common normalization technique used in image processing. This step helps to reduce the impact of variations in lighting and contrast in the images.

In order to assess the performance of the deep learning model, a portion of the data (10%) was set aside for validation purposes. To improve the robustness of the model, data augmentation was performed by randomly flipping some of the images horizontally. This helped to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent the model from overfitting on the training data.

The deep learning model architecture consisted of a sequence of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a series of fully connected layers. The convolutional layers learned features from the handwriting images, while the pooling layers reduced the dimensionality of the output. The fully connected layers combined these features to generate the final output. The model was trained using Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss function, and three evaluation metrics: accuracy, recall, and AUC.

The components of the in the proposed CNN model are:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: The model consists of three convolutional layers with filter sizes of 32, 64, and 256, respectively. These layers use a kernel size of 3, which means the filter is applied to a 3x3 pixel patch of the input image. The activation function used in the convolutional layers is ReLU, which is a commonly used activation function in deep learning. The ReLU function helps to introduce non-linearity into the model, which is important for the model to learn complex features from the input image.

2. **Pooling Layers**: Pooling layers are used in CNNs to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers. These layers help to prevent overfitting and speed up the training process by down-sampling the feature maps. In the proposed CNN model, max-pooling layers are used with a pool size of 2. The max-pooling operation selects the maximum value from each 2x2 pixel patch of the feature map and returns a down-sampled feature map with half the size of the original. The down-sampled feature maps retain the most important features of the input image, making it easier for the model to classify the image accurately.

3. **Activation functions**: Activation functions are applied to the output of each layer in a neural network to introduce non-linearity into the model. Non-linearity is important because it allows the model to learn complex relationships between the input and output. In the proposed CNN model, ReLU activation functions are used in the convolutional layers and dense layers. The ReLU function returns the input if it is positive, and zero otherwise. This means that the output of the ReLU function is always non-negative, which helps to prevent the vanishing gradient problem that can occur during backpropagation. The final dense layer uses a sigmoid activation function, which returns a value between 0 and 1 representing the probability that the input image belongs to a particular class. The sigmoid function is commonly used in binary classification tasks because it returns a probability that can be easily interpreted as a class label.

To prevent overfitting, the model was trained for only 20 epochs with early stopping using ReduceLROnPlateau. This technique reduces the learning rate of the optimizer when the validation loss stops improving, which can help the model to converge to a better solution. The model achieved a high training accuracy of 99.11%, indicating that it had learned to identify patterns in the data that distinguish individuals with dysgraphia from those without.

Finally, the performance of the model was evaluated using a classification report that compared the true labels of the test data against the predicted labels from the model. This report provides valuable insights into the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model, which are crucial metrics for evaluating its effectiveness.

# Result
The proposed CNN model is a powerful technique for image classification tasks that can outperform traditional classification techniques like KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest due to several factors. Firstly, the CNN model is specifically designed for image classification tasks and has been trained on a large dataset of images, allowing it to learn complex features that are relevant to the classification task. This is particularly advantageous compared to other traditional classification techniques that may not be designed to capture features specific to images.

Secondly, the CNN model uses convolutional layers that can capture local patterns and relationships between adjacent pixels in the image. This allows the model to learn spatial features that are important for image classification tasks. This is in contrast to traditional classification techniques like Naive Bayes and decision trees that may not be able to capture these spatial features.

Thirdly, the CNN model uses a large number of parameters that can be tuned during the training process. This allows the model to learn high-level features that are useful for classification. On the other hand, traditional classification techniques like KNN and SVM may require a large amount of computational resources to optimize the parameters, which may limit their performance on large datasets.

Furthermore, the CNN model uses dropout regularization during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning models that can occur when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely. Dropout regularization can help to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out nodes during training, forcing the model to learn more robust features.

recall = (0.99*(200) + 0.84*(203)) / (200+203) = 91.44
