# data mining
- use of efficient techniques for *analysis* of very large collection of data and the *extraction* useful and possibly unexpected *patterns* in data
- why do we need data mining
	- huge amount of raw data maintained due to cheap storage (cloud storage)
	- we need to analyse this *raw data* to extract *knowledge*

# raw data
- multiple types
	- tables
	- time series
	- images
	- graphs, etc
- spatial and temporal aspects
- interconnected data of different types

## transaction data
- data regarding different kinds of transactions
- companies collect the information about the trasnactions generated from the users

## document data
- web pages
- articles
- online new portals
- short message form - twitter
- each document is like a vector
	- each term is a component (attribute) of the vector
	- value of each component is the number of times the corresponding term occurs in the document
	- in *bag-of-words* representation, there is no ordering

## network data
- web pages inks via hyperlinks
- the network traffic from one user to another over the internet

## genomic sequences
- sequences of genes

## environmental data
- database of different types of data for temperature, precipitation, pressure, etc.
- managed by government bodies

## behavioural data
- mobile phones capturing user behavioural data 
- human habits, tendencies, etc. 

# types of attributes
1. categorical
	- nominal - categories not having any ranking among them
	- ordinal - categories are ordered, but not comparable
	- special type - binary
2. numerical
	- discrete
	- continuous
