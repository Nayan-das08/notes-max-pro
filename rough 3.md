# Portfolio (first draft)

## 1. Introduction
The Human Value Community Outreach Program is a unique initiative aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of the fundamental values that shape our personal and collective lives. Through this program, we seek to cultivate a sense of social responsibility and empathy among students, empowering them to become agents of positive social change and contributors to national development.

At the heart of this program are the core course objectives, which include generating awareness of human values and social caring, reinstating the rich cultural legacy and human values, developing and enhancing the sense of individual responsibility towards society, acting as an agent of social change for national development, actively working towards national integration and communal harmony, and encouraging students to actively participate in national priorities while harnessing the use of technology for social good.

Through a combination of interactive lectures, workshops, and community outreach activities, students will have the opportunity to engage with these core values and develop the skills necessary to become ethical and responsible global citizens. By exploring diverse cultural traditions and historical perspectives, students will gain a deeper appreciation of the values that bind us together as a global community, while also developing a sense of social responsibility towards their fellow human beings.

We believe that this program has the potential to create a positive impact on society and to inspire future generations of leaders committed to creating a just and equitable world. We invite you to join us on this journey towards a better and more compassionate future.

## 3. Rationale of the study
The rationale of the HVCO Program is rooted in the belief that values play a crucial role in shaping our personal and collective lives. By promoting awareness and understanding of human values, we can create a more just, equitable, and compassionate society.

In recent times, we have witnessed a growing sense of disillusionment and disconnection among individuals and communities, leading to social and political unrest. This has highlighted the urgent need to reinforce the values that underpin human civilization and to promote a greater sense of social responsibility and empathy.

Through this program, we aim to provide students with the tools and knowledge necessary to become ethical and responsible global citizens. By cultivating an understanding of the fundamental values that shape our world, we can empower students to become agents of positive social change and contributors to national development.

Moreover, by reinstating the rich cultural legacy and human values, we can develop a deeper appreciation of the diversity and richness of human experience. This, in turn, can help to promote national integration and communal harmony, fostering a more peaceful and cohesive society.

In summary, the rationale of the study is to promote awareness and understanding of human values, to develop a sense of social responsibility and empathy among students, and to contribute to the creation of a more just, equitable, and compassionate society.

## 4. Area of study
The area of study for the HVCO program regarding community service, in collaboration with an NGO that works to educate underprivileged children and provide support to women who were victims of domestic violence, is a vital part of the program's objectives. The program aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to address the social challenges faced by these communities through community service.

As part of this area of study, we explored the cultural context and the social impact of the communities served by the NGO, as well as the specific needs of the beneficiaries of the NGO's services. They study the ethical and moral principles that underpin community service, as well as the models and strategies used to promote social change through community service.

Through our collaboration with the NGO, we gained practical experience working with underprivileged children and women who have been victims of domestic violence. This provided us with an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills gained through the program in a real-world setting, and to develop a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by these communities.

Through out participation in community service projects with the NGO, we gained practical experience working with diverse populations and develop skills in communication, leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. They also learn to reflect critically on their experiences and to apply the knowledge and skills gained through the program to their future service work.

Overall, the area of study for the HVCO program regarding community service, in collaboration with the NGO, provides us with a unique opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills, and practical experience needed to become effective agents of social change. It prepares us to work collaboratively with communities in a thoughtful and ethical manner and to promote the well-being of those they serve.

## 5. Methodology of study
The program was conducted over a period of three months, during which the following methods were used to achieve the program objectives:

1. **Participation in Institute Events**: To encourage participation in the events and drives organised by the institute, a system of communication was established through which the participants were informed about upcoming events and their objectives. Participants were then given the opportunity to register for events of their interest. Feedback was collected from the participants after each event to evaluate the success of the event and to identify areas for improvement.    
2. **Collaboration with GoodWorks NGO**: To raise awareness about the work of GoodWorks NGO, various communication methods were used, including social media posts, email communications, and poster displays. To make the collaboration effective, an agreement was reached between the program and GoodWorks NGO outlining the expectations of both parties. Feedback from the NGO was collected to evaluate the effectiveness of the communication methods.
3. **Visiting the NGO**: To interact with the children and teach them elementary subjects, the program participants visited the NGO. Before the visit, an orientation session was conducted to educate the participants on the work of the NGO and to discuss best practices for teaching children. During the visit, the children were taught basic subjects like GK and Math using various teaching aids. The participants also engaged in interactive activities with the children to develop their social skills.
