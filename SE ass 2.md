Module 3
Assigned: February 27, 2023
Deadline: March 3, 2023

1. Discuss the types and the objectives of software design. How you can transform any informal software design to a detailed software design? 
2. What are the objectives of modular software design? Discuss the various types of coupling and cohesion with their impact on software design.
3. If a module has logical cohesion, what kind of coupling is this module likely to have with other modules?
4. Analyse the given scenarios:
	1. Impact of high coupling between two modules
	2. Impact of low cohesion between two modules
5. Describe the various strategies to make a better software. How will you find which strategy is more practical?
6. Can a system be completely decoupled i.e. can the degree of coupling be reduced to the extent that there is no coupling?
7. Is it possible to have inheritance without polymorphism? Justify the answer.
8. Explain the complete process of requirement engineering.
9. What is software requirement specification document and why is it known as black box specification of the system?
10. Differentiate between:
	1. Functional and non functional requirements
	2. User and system requirements
11. Draw a DFE for result automation system for B.Tech. course of ASET. Clearly describe the working of the system and the assumptions you made.
12. An airline reservation is an association between a passenger, a flight and a seat. Select some appropriate attributes for each of these entities and draw the ER diagram.
13. How can you check the consistency of any SRS document? Explain with some examples.
14. Consider the problem of railway reservation system and elaborate the following:
	1. problem statement
	2. use case diagram
15. Perform a system investigation and analyse the system to determine operational, functional, hardware, software, input, output, process and requirements for the given system:
	- the university student registration system is unable to cope with the high volume of calls received at registration time. So an online student registration system needs to be developed.
