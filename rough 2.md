## EN doubt
1. do we send the frame with empty field?
	- yes
2. what is contained in the ARP request response?
	- the frame of request with the empty field of "Destination MAC Address" now filled with the appropriate value and the frame is sent with "Sender MAC Address" in its place (coz end-device roles are inverted)
	- request is broadcast, reply is unicast
	- request sent before sending the required frame
		- it is a sub-task

## en expt 9
1. connect PCs to Switch
2. connect Switch to Router (gigabitethernet)
3. connect servers to switch (Fastethernet)
4. router - config - interface - g0/0/0 - port status ON mf
5. `Router(config-if)#ip address 192.168.100.1 255.255.255.0`
6. server0 - services - dhcp - service on - change pool name - add default gateway (prev ip address) - put any IP address in start IP address and put Subnet mask
7. server1 - services - dns - ON
8. server1 - config - dhcp ON
9. server2 - config - dhcp ON
10. server2 - HTTP - edit an HTML page as per requirement and save
11. server1 - DNS - add any name - put the IP address of server2 - add the Domain name
12. open any PC - desktop - web browser - put URL `https://<ip address of server2>` - GO
13. the HTML page set in server2 is shown

>[!NOTE]
>- server0 = dhcp server
>- server1 = dns server
>- server2 = web server

>[!NOTE]
>- 169.254.186.141 server2 ip address



public IPv4 addresses - which are routable

a corp hq has been allocated a pub network address of `172.16.0.0/22` by ISP
corp hq has dmz and 4 brnach offices with each neeiding its own public IPv4
