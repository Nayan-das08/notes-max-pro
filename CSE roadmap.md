# Coursera write-ups
I am an undergrad student at Amity University currently in my 3rd year majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am a student with no income and therefore it is not possible for me to pay the fee. Also, my major is computer engineering, therefore, this course will help me a lot in developing a skill that will help me in improving my skills. I want to start my career in Artificial Intelligence, and this can be a great start for my career. That is why I want this financial aid. I will commit to all my deadlines and will try my best to complete the course. As a tech enthusiast, I want to learn Machine Learning and I will commit to all the deadlines for the course. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.

I want to start my career in Machine Learning, and this can be a great start for my career. That is why I want this financial aid. I will commit to all my deadlines and will try my best to complete the course. As a tech enthusiast, I want to learn deep learning and I will commit to all the deadlines for the course. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
