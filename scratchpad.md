## important questions/topics for minor and end term
1. explain the different maximum entropy models
2. write short notes on articulative primitives, auditory primitives and acoustic primitives.
3. discuss important tools available for the development of NLP applications.
4. explain transfer model of machine translation and its 3 phases.
5. explain different stages speech recognition system.
6. numerical
	1. design a finite state transducer with E insertion orthographic rule that parses from surface level "spoons" through the lexical phases "spoon+N+PL".
	2. identify the head and morphological types (noun, phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase, adverbial phrase) of the following sentence
		- the student of the school
		- looked up the star
		- angry as a lion
		- rapidly like a mosquito
	3. in a corpus of N documents, one randomly chosen document contains a total of T terms and the term "hello" appears K times. what is the correct value for the product of TF (term frequency) and IDF (Inverse Document Frequency), if the term "hello" appears in approximately 1/3 of the total documents.
		- $TF = K/T$ 
		- $IDF = log_{10}(\text{total document} / \text{no. of documents containing data})$

Subject: Application for re-minor examination in Data Mining and Business Intelligence (IT402)

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a re-minor examination in the subject Data Mining and Business Intelligence (IT402). I was unable to take the examination on 19/09/2024 due to medical reasons.

On the morning of 19th September, I was feeling unwell due to diarrhea. I have attached a copy of my medical certificate for your reference.

I am now fully recovered and eager to take the re-minor examination. I would be grateful if you could grant my request for a re-minor examination in Data Mining and Business Intelligence (IT402). Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
Nayan Ranjan Das
