## prototyping model
- aelirer models needed definite designs
- they lack customer interaction
- enter, this one
- cinverns the approval of customers
- can;t move fwd till customer is satisdaied
- time consuming
- 4 types
	- throwaway
		- prepare something, dont like, throw, create from scratch again
	- evolutionary
		- dont throw, modify/refine
- pahses
	- initial req
	- design and eval
		- prototyping
		- customer eval
		- review and updation
		- design
	- dev
	- test
	- deploy/maintain

## spiral model
- concerns risk identification, analysis, prioritization, handling
- simple figure = 4 quads
	- req analysis
	- coding and tesitn
	- eval
	- risk analysis and planning
		- has to be done parallely along with all the phases

## interative model
- 3 iterations consisting of phases
- modular
- dont move till one module/iteration is satisfactory

## incremental model
- worst (more than waterfall? ou yea)
- do all phases $n$ times
- lot of deployment time

## CMM
>how mature the organization is?
- prev models don't consider the structure/characterisitics/standand of org
- this models the level of the org
- how much can they handle
- 5 levels
	1. **initial**
		- org characterized by *ad hoc activities*
		- *very few* processes defined and followed
		- diff engineers folo their own standards/processes
		- resulting effort becomes chaotic
		- called *chaotic level*
		- success only due to some individuals
	2. **repatable**
		- basic project management practices (cost and schedule) are followed
		- use cost estimation techniques
		- focus on same kinds of problems
	3. **defined**
		- processes for *management* are mainained along with that for development
		- common org wide understanding of activities, etc
		- *product qualities* are not defined
	4. quantitatively managed
		- focus on software metrics
		- 2 types of metrics collected
			- *product metrics*
				- size
				- reliability
				- time complexity
				- understandability
			- *process metrics* (testing)
				- avg defect correction time
				- avg no of defects found per hour of inspection
	5. optimizing
		- have everything
- customer side constraints force them to move down the levels

## software quality
>conformance to req and/or fitness of use
- customer satisfaction + internal parameter checks
- quality models
	- McCall's
	- Boehm's
	- ISO 9000

> [!NOTE]
> agile methodology
