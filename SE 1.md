- waterfall model
	- when *requirements are well understood*, fixed and the technology is stable
- v shaped
	- when *testing is critical* and the testing phase is emphasized
- prototype
	- when *requirements are unclear* and prototypes need to be shown
- spiral 
	- when the project is complex and high risk
	- requirements are unclear
	- when constant feedback is needed.
- iterative 
	- when requirements are not well understood,
	- there is a need to get a working prototype quickly.
- incremental
	- when there are changing requirements 
	- when the technology is not well understood

## prototyping model
- aelirer models needed definite designs
- they lack customer interaction
- enter, this one
- cinverns the approval of customers
- can;t move fwd till customer is satisdaied
- time consuming
- 4 types
	- throwaway
		- prepare something, dont like, throw, create from scratch again
	- evolutionary
		- dont throw, modify/refine
- pahses
	- initial req
	- design and eval
		- prototyping
		- customer eval
		- review and updation
		- design
	- dev
	- test
	- deploy/maintain

## spiral model
- concerns risk identification, analysis, prioritization, handling
- simple figure = 4 quads
	- req analysis
	- coding and tesitn
	- eval
	- risk analysis and planning
		- has to be done parallely along with all the phases

## interative model
- 3 iterations consisting of phases
- modular
- dont move till one module/iteration is satisfactory

## incremental model
- worst (more than waterfall? ou yea)
- do all phases $n$ times
- lot of deployment time

## CMM
>how mature the organization is?
- prev models don't consider the structure/characterisitics/standand of org
- this models the level of the org
- how much can they handle
- 5 levels
	1. **initial**
		- org characterized by *ad hoc activities*
		- *very few* processes defined and followed
		- diff engineers folo their own standards/processes
		- resulting effort becomes chaotic
		- called *chaotic level*
		- success only due to some individuals
	2. **repatable**
		- basic project management practices (cost and schedule) are followed
		- use cost estimation techniques
		- focus on same kinds of problems
	3. **defined**
		- processes for *management* are mainained along with that for development
		- common org wide understanding of activities, etc
		- *product qualities* are not defined
	4. quantitatively managed
		- focus on software metrics
		- 2 types of metrics collected
			- *product metrics*
				- size
				- reliability
				- time complexity
				- understandability
			- *process metrics* (testing)
				- avg defect correction time
				- avg no of defects found per hour of inspection
	5. optimizing
		- have everything
- customer side constraints force them to move down the levels

---
## software quality
- conformance to req and/or fitness of use
- customer satisfaction + internal parameter checks

### quality models
- **McCall's**
	- three perspectives
		- *product revision*
			1. maintainability
			2. flexibility
			3. testability
		- *product transition*
			1. portability
			2. reusability
			3. interoperability
		- *product operation*
			1. correctness
			2. reliability
			3. efficiency
			4. integrity
			5. usabillity

- **Boehm's**
	- seven quality factors
		1. portability
		2. reliability
		3. efficiency
		4. usability
		5. testability
		6. understandability
		7. flexibility

- **ISO 9000**
	- guidelines for maintaining a quality system
	- *ISO 9001* for orgs in design, development, production, servicing
	- *ISO 9002* for orgs in production
	- *ISO 9003* for orgs in installation and testing
	- main requirements of ISO 9001
		1. management responsibility
		2. quality system
		3. contract reviews
		4. design control
		5. document control
		6. purchasing
		7. purchaser supplied products
		8. product identification
		9. process control
		10. inspection and testing
		11. inspection, measuring, test quipment
		12. inspection and test status
		13. control of noncomforming product
		14. corrective action
		15. handling
		16. quality records
		17. quality audits
		18. training
	- feautures of ISO 9001
		- all docs should e properly managed
		- proper plans should be prepared
		- imp docs be checked for effectiveness
		- product should be tested against specification
		- org aspects should be addressed
