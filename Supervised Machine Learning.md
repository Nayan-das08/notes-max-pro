## what is it?
Refers to the algorithms that learn by learning **how to map vector of inputs $X$ to output label $y$.**

The algorithms receives/learns from **correct examples** of problem conditions and the corresponding solution.

The process is analogous to how a child learns about different things as its parents teach it with correct examples. For example, by analysing the features of a dog, we can easily identify the animal as a dog because we were trained how a dog looks like.

## popular applications
- spam filtering (emails), 
- speech recognition, 
- language translation, 
- online advertising
- self driving car
- visual inspection in factories

## types of algorithms
The supervised algorithms can be classified into two groups:
- **Regression**
- **Classification**

## Regression
It can be described as prediction of output quantity for some new input value

It works to establish a **relationship between the input vector $X$ and the output value $y$**. We refer to the output as a *value* as the output in case of regression is quantitative data. For qualitative data, we use Classification

Some common examples are:
- predicting house pricing on the basis of various characteristics that one might deem important for this analysis
- understanding relationship between advertising and profit/sales
- studying relationship between drug dosage and various parameter changes in the body
