## heading
## CMM
>how mature the organization is?
- prev models don't consider the structure/characterisitics/standand of org
- this models the level of the org
- how much can they handle
- 5 levels
	1. initial
		- org characterized by *ad hoc activities*
		- *very few* processes defined and followed
		- diff engineers folo their own standards/processes
		- resulting effort becomes chaotic
		- called *chaotic level*
		- success only due to some individuals
	2. repatable
		- basic project management practices (cost and schedule) are followed
		- use cost estimation techniques
		- focus on same kinds of problems
	3. defined
		- processes for *management* are mainained along with that for development
		- common org wide understanding of activities, etc
		- *product qualities* are not defined
	4. quantitatively managed
		- focus on software metrics
		- 2 types of metrics collected
			- *product metrics*
				- size
				- reliability
				- time complexity
				- understandability
			- *process metrics* (testing)
				- avg defect correction time
				- avg no of defects found per hour of inspection
	5. optimizing
		- have everything
- customer side constraints force them to move down the levels
