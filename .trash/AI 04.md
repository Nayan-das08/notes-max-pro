## classes of production system
1. **monotonic**
	1. when two rules are applied simultaneously
	2. one rule doesn't affect the other
	3. can co-exist
2. **non monotonic**
	1. increases problem solving efficiency
	2. eliminates prev records
	3. does not allow backtracking
	4. used for solving ignorable problems
3. **partially commutative**
	1. when 2 or more rules used to derive a result
	2. combination of the same rules produces the same result
4. **commutative**
	1. for problems in which changes can reverse the outcome
	2. sequence of operation is not critical


## control strategies
which rule has to be applied next while searching for the soln of a problem witin problem space, w/o getting stuck at any point

requirements
- control stategy should cause motion
- control stategy should be systematic
