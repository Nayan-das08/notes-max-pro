Dear Sir,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I, Nayan Ranjan Das from 7CSE2 (3rd Year), have been selected CSIR - National Physical Laboratory, Pusa Road, New Delhi for my NTCC industry internship. I am pleased to share that this will be an onsite internship.

I have successfully uploaded my Synopsis and Offer Letter on the Amizone portal and kindly request your approval for the same. Due to the preoccupation with the onsite internship, I regret to inform you that I will not be able to come to the campus in person.

I would be highly grateful if you could consider my request.

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
Nayan Ranjan Das
