# Abstract
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) collected data that was utilised to create high-resolution astronomical photographs. This review paper discusses several digital image processing techniques employed for those images. The study gives a general review of imaging technology, including the difficulties in processing the data once an image has been captured. After that, it investigates various image-processing methods, providing a framework for using intensity scaling, colour, and composition to generate contrasts in images that emphasise scientific information in detail. The study contrasts the effectiveness of each strategy using actual astronomical data while also outlining the benefits and drawbacks of each method. The exploration of the potential applications of digital image processing in astronomy and numerous examples of processing applied to astronomical bodies round out the paper's conclusion. Overall, this review paper offers a thorough road map for astronomers and researchers interested in enhancing the resolution and calibre of astronomical photographs by making use of digital image processing techniques.

# 1. Introduction
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope are two of the most important imaging instruments in the field of astronomy. While often referred to as Hubble's successor, Webb has a unique scientific mission that builds on the achievements of its predecessor. With its large primary mirror and impressive infrared capabilities, Webb has the ability to explore the earliest stages of the universe's formation, including the emergence of our solar system and the earliest signs of cosmic light following the Big Bang.

While both telescopes have gathered invaluable scientific data, the quality of their images is not always sufficient to reveal the shapes, colors, and textures of celestial bodies. As such, digital image processing techniques have become essential tools for enhancing the quality of the photographs captured by these instruments. These techniques involve the use of spectroscopic analysis, noise reduction, image restoration, and color balancing to bring out the features of astronomical objects and enable further analysis by NASA experts.

To produce high-quality images for scientific and public consumption, image processors must carefully minimize the presence of artifacts while preserving the integrity of the data. The pre-processing stage of data preparation involves the detection and removal of various artifacts, as the data is initially collected in its most unprocessed form. Subsequently, individual photographs are combined and color-balanced to produce press release images.

One of the challenges associated with capturing images from distant celestial objects is the potential for extraneous light to enter the image as it travels through space and time. This may arise from a variety of sources, including internal reflections within the telescope and detector. As such, this review paper will explore various defects and artifacts that originate within the detector itself, as well as the techniques employed to minimize their impact on the captured images.

# 2. Scope of the Review
In this review, we will focus on four common issues that impact astronomical images - charge bleed, charge transfer inefficiency, dead and cold pixel problems, and mosaic artifacts. We will discuss these problems in detail and explore the various image processing techniques that have been developed to mitigate their impact on astronomical images.

**Charge Bleed**
Charge-coupled devices (CCD), the same kind of technology used in smartphone cameras, constitute the basis of Hubble's imaging detectors. When a source in the field of vision is sufficiently bright that it overwhelms specific detector pixels, this is known as charge bleed. The brighter portions of the image bleed into the darker area as a result. This can be quite challenging to clean up in photographs with extremely bright stars. Cleaning this artefact, though, ought to be simple if the bright star is surrounded by a largely homogeneous background. The best approach is to use actual data from a different image of the same source that has been rotated so that it can be used in place of the data in the bleed. In the absence of this ideal circumstance, charge bleed can be fixed by choosing and copying a clear portion of the star that is perpendicular to the bleed, rotating it 90 degrees, and then carefully blending it into the charge bleed, taking care not to obstruct or add elements to the image.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
It is inevitable that CCDs deteriorate and lose charge transfer efficiency as they get older, and CTE does alter with time. The data calibration programme essentially packs that charge back into its array of pixels thanks to the tools the software wizards at STScI have designed to account for this effect. The end user receiving data from MAST will almost never see this effect unless specifically looking for it because this fix is executed as part of the standard processing pipeline.

**Pixel Problems**
Dead pixels, Hot pixels, Cold pixels, Unstable pixels - all these terms are used to describe specific detector pixels that do not function as planned. They can either emit a maximum signal all the time (hot pixel) or no signal at all (dead pixel) depending on the situation. Most of the time, these are well known, are depicted on the detector, and may be considered during data calibration. In the WFC3/IR detector, for instance, there is a well-known circular region of dead pixels that has been affectionately dubbed the "death star" and is even included in planning software to assist scientists in avoiding placing anything significant on that region of the detector while arranging observations. These problematic pixels are inevitable throughout the creation of image detectors and are typically not a warning sign for more serious issues. The extreme conditions of space do cause the detectors to deteriorate with time, but again, these issue areas may be considered and dealt with in calibration. Once the data are merged to generate an integrated image, taking many exposures and slightly shifting the telescope or detector between exposures also aids in mitigating these issues.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
The sky is a very minor portion of Hubble's entire field of view.  Therefore, astronomers plan out numerous overlapping observations to construct a mosaic in order to obtain photographs that span a wider section of the sky. Then, these data must be precisely calibrated to ensure that the background levels are consistent from one mosaic frame to the next. Even with such meticulous calibration, there will inevitably be spots close to the overlaps that don't quite match and need to be fixed. Typically, this is done by making local brightness/contrast adjustments to match the backdrop levels. Science programmes don't always aim to produce a precisely square mosaic, thus there can be data gaps that might be filled in with information from other programmes or, if accessible, ground-based data.

# 3. Literature Review
The paper by Rector et al. (2007) presents a literature review on the image-processing techniques used in creating high-quality astronomical images. The authors discuss the challenges that astronomers face in obtaining clear and detailed images of celestial objects and the importance of processing the raw data to enhance the quality of the images. They review various image-processing techniques, including image stacking, filtering, and deconvolution, and their application in improving the signal-to-noise ratio, removing unwanted features, and enhancing the contrast and resolution of astronomical images. The authors also discuss the use of color balancing and merging techniques to create visually appealing and informative images for scientific and educational purposes. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the image-processing techniques used in modern astronomy and their role in producing high-quality astronomical images.

There are several papers that discuss the correction of astronomical image artifacts caused by the imperfections of the imaging equipment. Massey et al. (2010) present a pixel-based correction method for the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys that accounts for the charge transfer inefficiency of the detector. Desai et al. (2016) review various image artifact detection and removal techniques, including cosmic ray removal, background subtraction, and outlier rejection, which are commonly used in astronomical image processing. Massey et al. (2014) propose an improved model of charge transfer inefficiency and a correction algorithm for the Hubble Space Telescope. Together, these papers provide a comprehensive review of the techniques used in the correction of image artifacts in astronomical images, highlighting the importance of accurate image processing in astronomy research.

The literature on image processing techniques for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) includes recent papers that focus on addressing issues related to unstable or malfunctioning pixels in the imaging detectors. Medina (2021) provides an update to the UVIS bad pixel table pipeline, which is used to identify and flag pixels with high noise levels or instability in HST's UVIS instrument. Khandrika (2022) investigates the occurrence of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument and presents a detailed analysis of their impact on astronomical images. Both papers highlight the importance of accurate pixel characterization and correction techniques in producing high-quality astronomical images, particularly for sensitive imaging instruments on the HST. Together, these papers provide valuable insights into the ongoing efforts to improve the image processing techniques used in modern astronomy.

The paper by Desai et al. (2016) provides a comprehensive review of the techniques used in the detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images. The authors discuss the various types of artifacts that can affect astronomical images, including cosmic rays, bad pixels, diffraction spikes, and flat-fielding errors. They review the image processing techniques commonly used to detect and remove these artifacts, such as median filtering, outlier rejection, and interpolation methods. The authors also discuss the challenges posed by the large datasets and high sensitivities of modern astronomical instruments and the need for efficient and automated artifact removal methods. This paper provides valuable insights into the ongoing efforts to develop accurate and robust image processing techniques for astronomical research, which are crucial for obtaining clear and reliable data from sensitive imaging instruments.

Some miscellaneous literature on image processing techniques for astronomical images includes recent papers that explore new methods for representation learning and image fusion. Hayat et al. (2021) present a self-supervised representation learning approach for astronomical images that leverages the inherent structure and patterns in the data to learn feature representations without explicit supervision. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in detecting and classifying astronomical objects, highlighting the potential of self-supervised learning for improving the accuracy and efficiency of astronomical image analysis. Guilloteau et al. (2020) propose a hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion method that accounts for spectrally varying spatial blurs, which are common in high-dimensional infrared astronomical imaging. The authors evaluate the performance of their fusion method on simulated and real data, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness compared to traditional image fusion techniques. These papers showcase the ongoing efforts to develop innovative image processing techniques for astronomical research, with a focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of image analysis for a wide range of scientific applications.

# 4. Solutions and Techniques for Digital Image Processing in mitigating artifacts
In this section, we will explore the various techniques and solutions that have been developed to mitigate the impact of artifacts on astronomical images. These solutions include methods for removing cosmic rays and other types of noise from images, as well as techniques for correcting for charge transfer inefficiencies, dead and cold pixel problems, and mosaic artifacts. 

**Charge Bleed**
In the paper "Image-processing techniques for the creation of presentation-quality astronomical images," Rector et al. (2007) address the issue of charge bleed, which is a common problem encountered in astronomical imaging. Charge bleed occurs when an excess charge spills over from one pixel to another during readout, leading to blooming or streaking effects in the resulting images.

To mitigate the charge bleed problem, Rector et al. employed a number of image-processing techniques, including bias subtraction, flat-fielding, and cosmic ray rejection. Bias subtraction involves subtracting a bias frame, which is a dark image taken with zero exposure time, from each astronomical image to correct for the bias signal generated by the detector. Flat-fielding corrects for pixel-to-pixel variations in the detector response by dividing each astronomical image by a flat-field frame, which is an image of a uniformly illuminated field. Cosmic ray rejection involves identifying and removing cosmic rays, which are energetic particles that strike the detector and create spurious signal spikes.

In addition to these standard techniques, Rector et al. developed a novel approach to deal with charge bleed, which they call "charge-transfer tailoring." This method involves adjusting the timing and amplitude of the clock signals used to read out the detector in order to control the charge transfer between pixels. By carefully tuning the clock signals, Rector et al. were able to reduce the charge bleed and improve the image quality.

Overall, Rector et al.'s paper provides a comprehensive overview of the techniques used to create presentation-quality astronomical images, with a particular focus on addressing the charge bleed problem. Their use of both standard and novel techniques demonstrates the importance of a multi-faceted approach to image processing in astronomy.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) is a prevalent problem in astronomical imaging, particularly for space-based observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). CTI leads to a gradual loss of charge from pixels as they are transferred across the detector. This results in image artifacts such as trailing, streaking, and smearing, which can significantly affect the quality of scientific data. In this review, we discuss two papers that propose solutions for the charge bleed problem in HST's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).

The first paper by Massey et al. (2010) presents a pixel-based correction method for CTI in ACS. The authors developed an algorithm that uses a model of the detector's charge transfer process to correct the pixel values in each image. This model is based on the assumption that the charge transfer occurs along straight lines. The algorithm fits the pixel values along each line to this model and adjusts the pixel values to remove the CTI-induced artifacts. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method on both simulated and real ACS data, showing a significant improvement in image quality.

One of the most significant developments in this area came in 2014 when Massey et al. proposed an improved model of CTI and a correction algorithm for the HST. The model takes into account several factors that contribute to CTI, including variations in the charge transfer efficiency across the CCD detectors, the impact of cosmic rays on the detectors, and the non-uniform illumination of the CCDs. The correction algorithm developed by Massey et al. involves estimating the charge lost due to CTI by fitting a model to the charge trails left by stars in the image. This correction is then applied to the image to obtain an accurate representation of the original data.

The second paper by Desai et al. (2016) presents a more general approach to detecting and removing artifacts in astronomical images, including those caused by CTI. The authors proposed a method based on the use of median absolute deviation (MAD) maps. MAD maps are derived from the image data and provide an estimate of the expected noise level in each pixel. The authors used the MAD maps to identify pixels with anomalously high values, which they attributed to CTI-induced artifacts. The authors then used a combination of interpolation and local averaging to remove the artifacts from the images. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of their method on both simulated and real ACS data, showing a significant reduction in the CTI-induced artifacts.

CTI remains a significant challenge for astronomers using the HST, but researchers have made significant progress in developing solutions to this problem.

**Pixel Problems**
The following papers deal with pixel-related problems in the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instruments on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

The first paper by Medina, titled "UVIS Pixel Stability: Updates to The UVIS Bad Pixel Table Pipeline", discusses updates made to the Ultraviolet and Visual Light (UVIS) bad pixel table pipeline. The UVIS instrument on the HST is prone to developing bad pixels, which are pixels that produce incorrect or anomalous readings. These bad pixels can arise due to various reasons such as radiation damage, thermal stress, and manufacturing defects. The UVIS bad pixel table pipeline is responsible for identifying and flagging such bad pixels, which are then excluded from scientific analysis.

In the paper, Medina describes the various updates made to the pipeline to improve its performance in detecting bad pixels. These updates include changes to the algorithm used to identify bad pixels, improvements to the bad pixel table itself, and enhancements to the quality control procedures. Medina also presents results from various tests that demonstrate the improved performance of the updated pipeline.

The second paper by Khandrika, titled "Cold and Unstable Pixels in WFC3/IR", discusses a different type of pixel-related problem. The WFC3 instrument on the HST is equipped with an infrared channel (WFC3/IR), which can develop cold and unstable pixels. Cold pixels are those that exhibit lower than expected signal levels, while unstable pixels are those that exhibit random fluctuations in signal levels. These types of pixels can affect the accuracy of scientific observations and can lead to erroneous results.

Khandrika's paper discusses a detailed analysis of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument, including their frequency and spatial distribution. The paper also presents a novel method for mitigating the effects of these pixels using a statistical approach that involves fitting a probability density function to the pixel values. The results of this approach demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of scientific observations made using the WFC3/IR instrument.

In summary, both papers deal with pixel-related problems in different instruments on board the HST. The first paper discusses updates made to the pipeline responsible for identifying bad pixels in the UVIS instrument, while the second paper presents a novel method for mitigating the effects of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument. Both papers are important contributions to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of scientific observations made using the HST.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
In the paper "Detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images," the authors Shantanu Desai et al. propose a method for detecting and removing mosaic artifacts in astronomical images. Mosaic artifacts are introduced into the image due to the stitching together of multiple images taken by a camera. These artifacts can have a significant impact on the scientific analysis of the images.

The proposed method consists of three main steps: artifact detection, artifact characterization, and artifact removal. In the artifact detection step, the authors identify regions in the image that are likely to contain artifacts. This is done by comparing the statistical properties of each region with the properties of the entire image. Regions that are significantly different are classified as potential artifacts.

Once potential artifacts are identified, the next step is artifact characterization. In this step, the authors use a combination of visual inspection and statistical analysis to determine the type of artifact present. This information is used in the next step to guide the artifact removal process.

Finally, in the artifact removal step, the authors use a combination of image processing techniques to remove the identified artifacts. This includes techniques such as median filtering, inpainting, and interpolation. The specific technique used depends on the type of artifact present and its characteristics.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on real astronomical images. The authors show that the method is able to detect and remove a wide range of mosaic artifacts, including those caused by imperfect flat fielding, CCD defects, and cosmic ray hits.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive and effective method for detecting and removing mosaic artifacts in astronomical images. The proposed method is likely to be useful for astronomers and astrophysicists who rely on high-quality images for their research.

# 5. Analysis
The previous sections of this review have discussed various techniques for mitigating the impact of artifacts on astronomical images. In this section, we will evaluate the strengths and limitations of these techniques. While each technique has its advantages, they also have limitations that must be taken into account when selecting the most appropriate method for a given research problem. For example, some techniques may be more effective for correcting specific types of artifacts, while others may have higher computational requirements that limit their use for large datasets. Additionally, some techniques may introduce their own artifacts or distortions into the image, which must be carefully evaluated and accounted for. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of these techniques, we can gain a better understanding of their applicability and inform future research in digital image processing for astronomical research.

**Charge Bleed**
Rector et al.'s (2007) paper on "Image-processing techniques for the creation of presentation-quality astronomical images" provides a comprehensive analysis of various image processing techniques employed to create high-quality astronomical images. While the paper has some limitations, such as focusing on a specific instrument and the charge bleed problem, its detailed analysis of the techniques used and their impact on image quality is valuable for researchers and astronomers working in the field. Additionally, the authors' efforts to create presentation-quality astronomical images are commendable and can have significant benefits for public outreach and education in astronomy.

Overall, Rector et al.'s paper provides a useful guide for researchers and astronomers seeking to produce high-quality astronomical images. The authors' detailed analysis of the various image processing techniques, including their advantages and limitations, along with their novel approach to charge-transfer tailoring, demonstrates the importance of a multi-faceted approach to image processing in astronomy. As astronomical imaging continues to be a critical tool for studying the universe, the techniques and insights provided in this paper will undoubtedly prove invaluable for future astronomical research.

**Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE)**
The papers by Massey et al. (2010, 2014) and Desai et al. (2016) provide effective solutions to address image artifacts in astronomical imaging, specifically the CTI problem in the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys. While the pixel-based correction method by Massey et al. (2010) has limitations in assuming a linear charge transfer process and requiring knowledge of detector properties, the improved model by Massey et al. (2014) provides a more accurate correction. The method proposed by Desai et al. (2016) relies on MAD maps to distinguish CTI-induced artifacts, but may not be sufficient in cases of high noise or image features. Despite these limitations, all three methods have merits and provide valuable contributions to the field of astronomical imaging.

**Pixel Problems**
Both the papers discussing the mitigation techniques provide valuable contributions to the ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and reliability of scientific observations made using the HST. The first paper by Medina provides an updated pipeline for identifying and excluding bad pixels in the UVIS instrument, while the second paper by Khandrika proposes a statistical method for mitigating the effects of cold and unstable pixels in the WFC3/IR instrument.

While both papers have some minor limitations, such as the lack of direct comparison between old and new pipelines in the first paper and the assumption of a specific probability distribution function in the second paper, they nonetheless provide important insights and solutions to pixel-related problems in different HST instruments. These contributions are particularly important given the high cost and complexity of operating the HST and the need for accurate and reliable scientific observations to advance our understanding of the universe.

**Mosaic Artifacts**
While the paper "Detection and removal of artifacts in astronomical images" proposes a useful approach for addressing artifacts in astronomical images, it has some limitations and inconsistencies that should be noted. Nevertheless, the paper's proposed approach of using image inpainting with a patch-based method, combined with outlier detection and removal, has merit and provides a useful way to improve the accuracy and quality of scientific analysis. The paper's emphasis on the importance of detecting and addressing pixel problems in astronomical images is also noteworthy.

Overall, these papers provide useful insights into the solutions to specific problems in astronomical imaging. However, further research is needed to address the limitations and inconsistencies among the papers and to develop more comprehensive and efficient techniques for solving these problems.

# 6. Discussion
The review of the papers on charge bleed, charge transfer efficiency, pixel problems, and mosaic artifacts in the Hubble Space Telescope has several implications for theory, practice, and policy in the field of astronomical imaging.

Firstly, the findings of these papers demonstrate the importance of understanding the limitations and challenges of the equipment used in astronomical imaging. This knowledge is critical in ensuring that the data obtained is accurate, reliable, and free from errors that can negatively impact the scientific conclusions drawn from it.

Secondly, the review highlights the need for continued research and development in the field of astronomical imaging. As new challenges and problems arise, such as those highlighted in the papers, new solutions and techniques must be developed to address them. This highlights the importance of ongoing investment in research and development in the field of astronomy.

Thirdly, the review underscores the need for rigorous quality control measures in astronomical imaging. As demonstrated by the papers on charge bleed and pixel problems, errors and artifacts can be introduced at various stages of the imaging process, and without proper quality control measures, these errors can go undetected and lead to inaccurate conclusions.

Finally, the findings of the review have implications for policy in the field of astronomy. The review highlights the need for policies that promote collaboration and sharing of data and techniques among researchers to ensure the highest quality data and the most accurate scientific conclusions. It also underscores the importance of policies that promote investment in research and development in the field of astronomical imaging to continue to advance the state of the art and enable new discoveries.

# 7. Future Work
Based on the review of the papers related to solving problems in astronomical images obtained by the HST, there are some potential areas for future research that can address the gaps or limitations in the current literature.

For the charge bleed problem, future research can focus on the development of more advanced algorithms that can effectively remove charge bleeding trails from astronomical images. Additionally, more experiments can be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms in different scenarios.

For the charge transfer efficiency problem, future research can investigate the effects of CTE on other types of astronomical instruments and datasets beyond those obtained by the HST. This can provide a better understanding of how CTE affects astronomical imaging and inform the development of new methods to mitigate CTE.

For the pixel problem, future research can explore the use of deep learning techniques to identify and correct pixel defects caused by cosmic rays. Additionally, the effectiveness of different image defect correction techniques can be compared and evaluated using a large dataset obtained from different astronomical instruments and conditions.

For the mosaic artifacts problem, future research can focus on developing more advanced post-observation processing techniques that can effectively remove blotching artifacts from mosaic images. Furthermore, the impact of different processing techniques on the final image quality can be evaluated and compared using a standardized evaluation framework.

Overall, future research can focus on developing more advanced techniques and algorithms to address the limitations and inconsistencies of current methods for solving problems in astronomical imaging. Additionally, experiments can be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in different scenarios and datasets to ensure their practicality and generalizability.

# 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, this review paper has explored various solutions proposed by researchers to address common problems in astronomical imaging, including charge bleed, charge transfer efficiency (CTE), pixel problems, and mosaic artifacts. While each solution has shown promising results in improving image quality, there are limitations and inconsistencies among the different approaches. Future research could focus on addressing these limitations and exploring alternative techniques to further improve astronomical imaging. Nevertheless, the advancements in image processing and correction techniques have allowed astronomers to obtain more accurate and detailed observations of celestial objects, furthering our understanding of the universe.
